<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The history of Mindanao prior to the advent of Islam
is traditional and mythological, and no effort has been made to put it
on record. With Islam came knowledge, art, and civilization. A new
system of government was instituted and its records were registered.
<i>Tarsila</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e882src" href="#xd21e882"
name="xd21e882src">1</a> were written and the noble lineage of the
datus was carefully kept. Each sultanate or datuship kept a separate
genealogy. These genealogies, called <i>tarsila</i> or <i>salsila</i>,
were very limited in their scope and brief in their narration of
events. They are our only source of written information on the early
history of the Moros, and are valuable on that account. Previously the
Moros withheld these <i>tarsila</i> and kept them away from all
foreigners and non-Mohammedans; but their attitude has changed lately,
and several different <i>salsila</i> were secured from the chief datus
of the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
<p>The original manuscripts could not be bought, but exact and true
copies of the same have been secured and translated and their
translations are herein published for the first time.</p>

<h4 class="main">The Transliteration</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These <i>tarsila</i> are written in the Magindanao
dialect with Arabic characters, and a great part of their text is
Magindanao names which have never yet been expressed by means of
Romanic characters. In translating these <i>tarsila</i> such a large
number of words have to be transliterated that it is deemed necessary
to adopt a system of transliteration which can be easily understood by
every English reader and which is more adequate to express Magindanao
sounds than either Spanish or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>English. Such a system is herein
adopted and is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>With the exception of <i>ng</i> and <i>sh</i>, the characters used
in this system are simple and represent simple sounds only. Every
radical modification of a certain simple sound is regarded as a
different simple sound and is represented by a separate and distinct
character. Every compound sound is represented by those characters that
express its simple constituent sounds. It is an unvarying rule in this
system that every character represents an invariable sound and every
sound has only one invariable character. The Magindanao dialect has
only twenty-seven simple sounds and can be expressed by twenty-seven
simple characters. These characters are the following:</p>
<p class="xd21e920"><i>a, &#257;, i, &#299;, u, &#363;, &#365;, b, d,
g, ng, h, j, k l, m, n, &ntilde;, p, q, r, s, sh, t, w, y, z</i></p>
<p>The sounds which these characters represent conform very closely to
the original Roman sounds of the letters.</p>

<p>The triphthongs herein expressed by <i>tsha</i> and <i>n&#772;ya</i>
are used in words of Malay origin, and are represented by single
characters in Malay and Magindanao.</p>
<p>In many cases when <i>u</i> precedes <i>w</i> and <i>i</i> precedes
<i>y</i> the natives omit the <i>u</i> and the <i>i</i>, and the same
word may be written either with or without the <i>u</i> or the
<i>i</i>. When written they are pronounced very short; <i>&#365;</i> at
the beginning of a word, as in <i>&#365;ndu</i>,
<i>&#365;ngg&#363;</i>, is often omitted both in pronunciation and in
writing. Such words may be written <i>ndu</i> and <i>ngg&#363;</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=

<p>To write Magindanao words by means of Arabic characters correctly a
certain knowledge of Arabic grammar and orthography is necessary. The
Moros lack that knowledge and write very inaccurately and
inconsistently. They neither punctuate nor use the accent sign.</p>
<p>In transliterating these <i>tarsila</i> that pronunciation which
seemed consistent and characteristic of each <i>tarsila</i> was adopted
in the transliteration of the same. The text is punctuated. The accent
sign is used very frequently. It is generally omitted when the accent
is upon the first syllable in words of two syllables and when it is
upon the syllable containing the long vowel. Some stress should be put
on the last syllable as a rule.</p>
<p>The Magindanao tongue is energetic and strong. Its pronunciation is
generally forcible, the last syllable being spoken abruptly and with a
certain amount of stress.</p>
<p>The word Mohammed is written with <i>o</i> in spite of the fact that
it is pronounced with <i>u</i> sound in both Arabic and Magindanao.</p>
<p>The combinations <i>ay</i>, <i>&#257;y</i>, <i>aw</i>,
<i>&#257;w</i> are not diphthongs, but simple syllables. The <i>y</i>
and <i>w</i> in these cases and in all cases where they precede a vowel
have pure and distinct consonantal sounds.</p>

<h4 class="main">A Geographical Sketch of the Chief Moro Settlements
Mentioned in the Tarsila of Mindanao</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The term Mindanao<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1290src"
href="#xd21e1290" name="xd21e1290src">2</a> or Magindanao was
originally given to the town now known as Cotabato and its immediate
vicinity. As the power of the sultan of Magindanao extended over the
adjacent territory it was next applied to the lower Rio Grande Valley
and later to all the valley and the whole seacoast that was brought
under the rule of the sultan. The word is derived from the root
&ldquo;danao,&rdquo; which means inundation by a river, lake, or sea.
The derivative &ldquo;Mindanao&rdquo; means &ldquo;inundated&rdquo; or
&ldquo;that which is inundated.&rdquo; &ldquo;Magindanao&rdquo; means
&ldquo;that which has inundation.&rdquo; This is the most appropriate
term which could have been given to this land. For more than 10 miles
from the sea the Rio Grande, aided by the rise of the tide,
periodically overflows its banks and floods all the adjacent lands. In
the rainy season this inundation extends farther up and includes an
extensive tract of country. The word &ldquo;Cotabato&rdquo; is in Moro
<i>kuta watu</i>, which means a stone fort. <i>Batu</i> is the
equivalent of <i>watu</i> in Malay, Sulu, Tagalog, and Visaya. This
name is very modern, for the older maps that are still in use give the
name Mindanao in place of Cotabato. The little stream that rises in the
sulphur springs of Cotabato and empties into the Rio Grande at its
junction with the Matampay in front of the present guardhouse is still
known as the Stream of Magindanao. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>The name of the Rio Grande in the Magindanao dialect is
&ldquo;Pulangi,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;large river.&rdquo; The Rio
Grande divides, 20 miles before it reaches the sea, into the north
branch and the south branch. Cotabato is situated on the left bank of
the north branch, about 5 miles from its mouth. The hill of Cotabato is
called &ldquo;Tantawan,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;extensive
view.&rdquo; Paygwan means &ldquo;the place of washing,&rdquo; and is
on the left bank of the river at its mouth and above the bar. The
Spanish maps give it as Paiuan. Tinundan is at the mouth of a dead
estuary of the same name that joins the Pulangi about half a mile above
Paygwan and on the same side. Slangan is the western part of present
Cotabato and extends along the Manday stream. The Moros call the Manday
&ldquo;Masurut.&rdquo; Simway extends along the river of the same name
for about 2 miles from its mouth and lies about 4 miles north of
Cotabato.</p>
<p>The Matampay River is a dead stream which joins the Pulangi at
Cotabato. Tagiman is the name of an old settlement built on the
Matampay River some distance above Cotabato. It is now called Binilwan.
Matampay and Lusud&#365;n were built on the Matampay River east of
Cotabato. Katitwan is an old settlement on the right bank of the river
3 miles below Libungan. Libungan is built at the junction of a river of
the same name with the Pulangi, about 9 miles above Cotabato. The point
at the fork is called Tambao. Three miles below Tambao on the right
bank of the south branch is the site of Bagumbayan. Three miles below
Bagumbayan on the left bank of the river is Taviran or Tapidan. Ten
miles below Taviran comes Tamontaka, which is nearly south of Cotabato
and about 4 miles distant. Tamontaka is about 4 miles from the mouth of
the south branch of the Pulangi. Lumb&#257;yan&aacute;gi lies a little
below Tamontaka, on the right bank of the river. Immediately above the
fork and on the left bank of the main river lies the old site of
Kabuntalan. Fourteen miles above the fork lies Dulawan, the settlement
at present occupied by Datu Piang. Here empties one of the largest
tributaries of the Pulangi, which is navigable by launches for 12 miles
farther up, to Sapakan, Datu Utu&rsquo;s main residence. Rak&#363;ngan
lies in the foothills of the Tiruray Mountains about 12 miles south of
Sapakan. Talayan lies in the foothills of the Tiruray Mountains 15
miles southwest of Dulawan. Two miles below Dulawan lies the old site
of Bwayan, on the left bank of the Pulangi. Opposite Bwayan and Dulawan
lies the land of Kudarangan. Tinunkup is Reina Regente and Kabarukan is
the wooded hill beyond. Sarunayan is the stretch of country lying north
of Reina Regente and northeast of Kudarangan and extending to the base
of the Kulingtan Mountains, which separate the Rio Grande Valley from
the Ranao region. The country occupying the declivities of these
mountains north of Sarunayan is called Pidatan. Bagu Ing&#365;d is an
old settlement that lies along the left bank of the river about 16 or
20 miles above Reina Regente. Matbangan is on the right bank of the
river and extends a short distance below Piket. The Malitigaw or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>Malidigaw is a large tributary of the Pulangi,
about 15 miles above Piket. Matinggawan is located at the junction of
the Kabakan tributary and about 30 miles above Piket. It is the chief
settlement of the last Moro district in the Rio Grande Valley whose
farthest boundary is the Mulita stream, which is about 115 miles by
river above Cotabato.</p>
<p>Immediately south of the mouth of the south branch of the Rio Grande
and rising above the seashore at L&#299;nuk is the lofty and
picturesque pyramidal peak of Mount Kabalalan. From Kabalalan and the
hills of Taviran there stretches an extensive mountainous region or
table-land which extends as far south as the Bay of Sarangani. This
table-land is designated as the Tiruray table-land or mountains for the
reason that its northern half is inhabited by the tribe of pagans of
the same name who are not met with anywhere else. The Bay of Sarangani
is called in Moro Sugud Bwayan. <i>Sugud</i> means &ldquo;bay,&rdquo;
and Bwayan is the chief settlement at the head of the bay. North of the
head of Sarangani Bay and at the southern terminus of one of the ranges
of the Apo system of mountains towers the picturesque and conical peak
of Mount Matutun. <i>Matutun</i> means &ldquo;burning,&rdquo; and the
mountain is an extinct volcano. Lying between Matutun on the east and
the previously mentioned table-land on the west is the country of
Talik. North of Talik lie Lake Buluan or Bulwan and farther north Lake
Ligwasan, which empties into the Rio Grande through a stream called
<i>Mayt&#365;m &#299;g</i> or black water. This junction occurs at
K&#365;km&#365;n, about 8 or 10 miles above Reina Regente.</p>
<p>Balabagan is about 10 miles south of Malabang. Magulalung is in the
neighborhood of Balabagan. The Iranun sultanate was on the shore of
Illana Bay, and the term <i>Iranun</i> signifies, in general, the
people who live along the shores of that bay. <i>Iranun</i> is also
pronounced and written as <i>Ilanun</i>; hence the corrupted Spanish
name given to the bay. The former Iranun sultanate must have occupied
the country in the vicinity of Malabang. Tubuk is the territory
immediately bordering on Malabang to the north of the Malabang stream.
Baras lies a few miles north of Malabang. Ram&#299;tan is in the
immediate vicinity of Baras.</p>
<p>Mal&#257;lis is near Tukurun. Dinas is the principal settlement on
the western coast of Illana Bay. Kumaladan is at the head of
Dumanquilas Bay. Sibugay is the name of the large bay east of the
Zamboanga peninsula.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;ranao&rdquo; means a lake and is the name the Moros
give to the upland lake lying midway between Malabang and Iligan and to
the region surrounding the lake. The mountain range separating the
Ranao table-land from the Rio Grande Valley is called the Kulingtan
Range on account of the resemblance its peaks bear to the knobs of the
row of <i>kulingtan</i> on which the Moros make their music. The
highest peak in this range north of Parang and above Bar&#299;ra is
supposed to be Mount B&#299;ta. The highest ridge west of Ranao is
called Mount Gurayn, at the base of which lies the settlement of
Bacolod or Bakulud. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Ranao settlements which are mentioned in the <i>tarsila</i> are
Kadingilan, Bayan, Makadar, and Bakayawan in the south, and the
Bay&#257;baw settlements of Mar&#257;wi (Marahui), Mad&#257;ya, and
others in the north; also S&#299;k&#365;n, Didag&#365;n, and
Dupilas.</p>
<p>At the time of the Spanish invasion of Mindanao all the southern and
western shores of the Island of Mindanao except the eastern shore of
Illana Bay were ruled and controlled by the sultan and datus of
Magindanao. The Ranao inhabitants are related to the Iranun in language
and tribal characteristics.</p>
<p>The word <i>Mindanao</i> unless restricted by the sense of the
sentence is generally used to mean the Island of Mindanao, while the
term <i>Magindanao</i> is limited to the old district or town of
Cotabato proper.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch1.5">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">The Mythology of Mindanao</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long ago, before the days of Kabungsuwan, Magindanao
was covered by water and the sea extended all over the lowlands and
nothing could be seen but mountains. The people lived on the highlands
on both sides. They were numerous and prosperous, and many villages and
settlements arose everywhere. But their prosperity and peace did not
last very long. There appeared in the land pernicious monsters which
devoured every human being they could reach. One of these terrible
animals was called <i>Kur&#299;ta</i>. It had many limbs and lived
partly on land and partly in the sea. It haunted Mount
Kabalalan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1365src" href="#xd21e1365" name=
"xd21e1365src">3</a> and extirpated all animal life in its vicinity.
The second was called <i>Tarab&#365;saw</i>. This ugly creature had the
form of a man, but was very much larger. It was extremely voracious and
spread terror far and wide. It haunted Mount Matutun and its
neighborhood.</p>
<p>The third was a monstrous bird called <i>Pah</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1379src" href="#xd21e1379" name="xd21e1379src">4</a> This bird
was so large when on the wing that it covered the sun and produced
darkness underneath. Its egg was as large as a house. It haunted Mount
Bita and the eastern Ranao region. It devoured the people and
devastated the land. The people were awe-struck, and those who escaped
hid themselves in the caves of the mountains.</p>
<p>The fourth was a dreadful bird, also, which had seven heads. It
lived in Mount Gurayn and the adjacent country.</p>
<p>The havoc was complete and the ruin of the land was awful. The sad
news found its way to strange and far lands, and all nations felt sorry
for the fate that befell Mindanao.</p>
<p>When the news reached Raja Indarapatra, the King of Mantapuli, it
grieved him very much and filled his heart with sympathy. Raja
Indarapatra called his brother, Raja Sulayman (Solomon) and asked him
to come to Mindanao to save the land from those destructive animals.
Raja <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>Sulayman was moved with sorrow, mingled with
enthusiasm and zeal, and consented to come. Raja Indarapatra handed to
his brother his ring and his kris, <i>Juru Pakal</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1399src" href="#xd21e1399" name="xd21e1399src">5</a> and
wished him safety and success. But before they parted Raja Indarapatra
took a sapling and planted it in the ground in front of his window.
This he thought was a sure sign by which he could tell what would
happen to Sulayman after his departure. He said to Sulayman, &ldquo;If
this tree lives, you will live also; and if this tree dies, you will
die too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raja Sulayman left Mantapuli and came over to Mindanao in the air.
He neither walked nor used a boat. The first place he reached was
Kabalalan. There he stood on the summit of the mountain and viewed the
land and the villages, but he could not see a single human being
anywhere. The sight was woeful, and Raja Sulayman exclaimed,
&ldquo;Alas, how pitiful and dreadful is this devastation!&rdquo; As
Sulayman uttered these words the whole mountain moved and shook, and
suddenly there came out of the ground a dreadful animal which attacked
Sulayman and fixed its claws in his flesh. The minute Sulayman saw the
<i>Kur&#299;ta</i> he knew that it was the evil scourge of the land,
and he immediately drew his sword and cut the <i>Kur&#299;ta</i> to
pieces.</p>
<p>From there Sulayman went to Matutun. There he saw greater
devastation and a more awful condition of affairs. As he stood on the
mountain he heard a noise in the forest and saw a movement in the
trees. Soon there appeared <i>Tarab&#365;saw</i>, which drew near and
gave a loud yell. It cautioned Sulayman and threatened to devour him.
Sulayman in his turn threatened to kill <i>Tarab&#365;saw</i>. The
animal said to Sulayman, &ldquo;If you kill me, I shall die the death
of a martyr,&rdquo; and as it said these words it broke large branches
from the trees and assailed Sulayman. The struggle lasted a long while,
until at last the animal was exhausted and fell to the ground;
thereupon Sulayman struck it with his sword and killed it. As the
animal was dying it looked up to Sulayman and congratulated him on his
success. Sulayman answered and said, &ldquo;Your previous deeds brought
this death on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next place Sulayman went to was Mount Bita. Here the devastation
was worse still. Sulayman passed by many houses, but they were all
vacant and not a soul lived there. &ldquo;Alas, what havoc and what
misfortune has befallen this country!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he went
on. But suddenly there came a darkness upon the land and Sulayman
wondered what it could mean. He looked up to the sky and beheld a
wonderful and huge bird descending from the sky upon him. He at once
recognized the bird and understood its purpose, and as quick as he
could draw his sword he struck the bird and cut off its wing. The bird
fell dead, but its wing fell on Sulayman and killed him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this same time Raja Indarapatra was sitting in his window, and he
looked and saw the little tree wither and dry up. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;Raja Sulayman is dead;&rdquo; and he wept.</p>
<p>Sad at heart but full of determination and desire for revenge, he
got up, put on his sword and belt, and came over to Mindanao to search
for his brother. He traveled in the air with wonderful speed and came
to Kabalalan first. There he looked around and saw the bones of the
<i>Kur&#299;ta</i> and concluded that his brother had been there and
had gone. At Matutun he saw the bones of <i>Tarab&#363;saw</i>, but
Sulayman was not there. So he passed on to Mount B&#299;ta and resumed
the search. There he saw the dead bird lying on the ground, and as he
lifted the severed wing, he saw the bones of Sulayman, and recognized
them by means of the sword that was lying by their side. As he looked
at the sword and at the bones he was overwhelmed with grief and wept
with tears. Raising up his head he turned around and beheld a small jar
of water near him. He knew that the jar was sent down from heaven, so
he took it and poured its water on the bones of his brother, and his
brother came to life again. Sulayman stood up, greeted his brother, and
talked with him. Raja Indarapatra had thought that Sulayman was dead,
but Sulayman assured him that he had not been dead, but that he had
been asleep. Raja Indarapatra rejoiced and life and happiness filled
his heart.</p>
<p>Raja Sulayman returned after that to Mantapuli, but Raja Indarapatra
continued his march to Mount Gurayn. There he met the dreadful bird
that had seven heads and killed it with his sword, <i>Juru
Pakal</i>.</p>
<p>Having destroyed all these noxious animals, and having restored
peace and safety to the land, Raja Indarapatra set himself searching
for the people that might have escaped destruction. He was of the
opinion that some people must have contrived to hide in the earth and
that they might be alive yet. One day during his search he saw a
beautiful woman at some distance, and as he hastened to meet her she
disappeared quickly through a hole in the ground where she was
standing. Having become tired and pressed with hunger, he sat down on a
rock to rest. Looking around for food, he saw a pot full of uncooked
rice and a big fire on the ground in front of it. Coming to the fire he
placed it between his legs and put the pot over his knees to cook the
rice. While so occupied he heard a person laugh and exclaim, &ldquo;Oh,
what a powerful person this man is!&rdquo; He turned around and, lo,
there was an old woman near by looking at him and wondering how he
could cook his rice on a fire between his legs. The woman drew nearer
and conversed with Raja Indarapatra, who ate his rice and stood talking
to her. He inquired of her about her escape and about the inhabitants
of the land. She answered that most of them had been killed and
devoured by the pernicious animals, but that a few were still alive.
She and her old husband, she said, hid in a hollow tree and could not
come out from their hiding place until Raja Sulayman killed the awful
bird, <i>Pah</i>. The rest of the people and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>the
datu, she continued, hid in a cave in the ground and did not dare to
come out again. He urged her to lead him to the cave and show him the
people, and she did so. The cave was very large, and on one side of it
were the apartments of the datu and his family. He was ushered into the
presence of the datu and was quickly surrounded by all the people who
were in the cave. He related to them his purpose and his mission and
what he had accomplished and asked them to come out and reinhabit the
land. There he saw again the beautiful girl whom he had observed at the
opening of the cave. She was the daughter of the datu, and the datu
gave her to him in marriage in appreciation of the good he had done for
them and the salvation he had brought to the land. The people came out
of the cave and returned to their homes, where they lived in peace and
prosperity again. At this time the sea had withdrawn and the lowland
had appeared.</p>
<p>One day as Raja Indarapatra was considering his return home he
remembered Sulayman&rsquo;s ring and went out to search for it. During
the search he found a net near the water and stopped to fish to
replenish his provisions for the continuation of the march. The net
caught a quantity of <i>buganga</i> fish, some of which he ate. Inside
one of the fish he found his ring. This cheered Raja
Indarapatra&rsquo;s heart and completed his joy. Later he bade his
father-in-law and his wife good-bye and returned to Mantapuli pleased
and happy.</p>
<p>Raja Indarapatra&rsquo;s wife was pregnant at the time of their
parting and a few months later gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl.
The boy&rsquo;s name was Rinamuntaw and the girl&rsquo;s name was
Rinayung. These two persons are supposed to be the ancestors of some of
the Ranao tribes or datus.</p>
<p>This narration was secured from Datu Kali Adam, who learned it from
the late Mahar&#257;ja Layla of Magindanao and from Alad, one of the
oldest and most intelligent Moros living. Alad says that Mantapuli was
a very great city far in the land of the sunset; where, exactly, he
does not know, but he is sure it was beyond the sea. Mantapuli was so
large, he said, and its people were so numerous, that it blurred the
eyes to look at them move; they crushed the bamboo very fine if it was
laid in the street one day.</p>
<p>Raja Indarapatra is the mythological hero of Magindanao and
Mantapuli is his city. These names are very frequently mentioned in
Moro stories, and various miracles are ascribed to them.</p>
<p>Kabalalan, Matutun, B&#299;ta, and Gurayn are the most prominent and
picturesque peaks of Mindanao and Ranao with which the Moros are
familiar. The whole narration is native and genuine, and is typical of
the Magindanao style and superstitions. Some Arabic names and
Mohammedan expressions have crept into the story, but they are really
foreign and scarcely affect the color of the story.</p>
<p>The animal <i>Kur&#299;ta</i> seems to bear some resemblance to the
big crocodiles that abound in the Rio Grande River.
<i>Tarab&#365;saw</i> may signify a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20"
href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>large variety of ape. A heinous
bird is still worshiped and is greatly feared by the Tirurays and
Manobos who live in the mountains south of Cotabato. The hateful
<i>Balbal</i>, in which all Moros believe, is described as a night
bird, and its call is supposed to be familiar and distinctly audible
every night.</p>
<p>What relation the names of <i>Rinamuntaw</i> and <i>Rinayung</i>
bear to the ancestors of the Ranao Moros it will be very interesting to
find out in the future.</p>

<p class="first">This manuscript is a copy of the original in the
possession of Datu Mast&#363;ra of Magindanao. The original copy is
neat and very well written. It gives first the descent of Kabungsuwan
from Mohammed, then a narrative of his departure from Juh&#363;r, his
arrival in Mindanao, and the conversion of the people of Mindanao to
Islam. The latter half of it gives the genealogy of the reigning family
of Bwayan from Pulwa to Pak&#299;h Mawl&#257;na and
Pak&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n, his brother. It is a very good type of the
style and composition of the Mindanao dialect. It is original and
borrows nothing of its text and form from either Malay or Arabic.</p>
<p>The combination of the genealogy of Bwayan with the story of the
conversion of Magindanao to Islam brings the history of Bwayan into
attention before that of Mindanao; but, as very little is known of the
early history of Bwayan, it matters not when it comes.</p>
<p>The rule of Bwayan extends all the way from the head of the delta or
from the <i>Kakal</i> (canal) to Bagu-Ing&#365;d, which is a few miles
below Piket. In fact the datus of the surrounding country, all through
the upper valley of the Rio Grande, owed more or less allegiance to the
rulers of Bwayan through all ages.</p>
<p>The sultan of Bwayan is known as Raja Bwayan. The rajas of Bwayan
attained a distinction and a power second to none, except that of the
sultan of Magindanao. The greatest datus of Bwayan who have figured
prominently in the recent history of the country are Datu &#362;t&#363;
and Datu Ali of Tinunkup, both of whom will be referred to later.</p>
<p>Diagram No. 1 ends with Sultan Sakandar. The relation between him
and Sultan Mayt&#365;m, the next raja of Bwayan, is not given in the
records. The second diagram begins with Sultan Mayt&#365;m and ends
with the present generation of rulers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Diagrams Nos. 1 and 2 show plainly that the sultanate
of Bwayan did not follow any direct line of succession, that the rajas
of Bwayan did not always stay at Bwayan, and that Bwayan was not the
only capital of the sultanate. The datus and the sultans of the
neighboring datuships who married the principal princesses of Bwayan
seem to have assumed the title of Raja Bwayan also.</p>
<p>The order of succession was a very complicated one. It is not stated
in the records nor can it be exactly inferred from the genealogies
kept. Sharif Ali of Sapakan gives the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Raja Sir&#363;ngan</li>
<li>2. Sultan Tambingag Kah&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>3. Sultan Sabaraba Jam&#257;lu-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>4. K&#257;yib Al&#299;mu-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>5. M&#257;lang Jal&#257;lu-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>6. Sah&#299;d Am&#299;ru-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>7. Sakandar Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam</li>
<li>8. Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na Al&#299;mu-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>9. Sultan Mayt&#365;m</li>
</ul>
<p>Sharif Afdal of Dulaw&#257;n gives the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Raja Sir&#363;ngan</li>
<li>2. Datu Map&#363;ti</li>
<li>3. Tap&#363;di</li>
<li>4. Tamay</li>
<li>5. M&#257;lang</li>
<li>6. Sakandar, Sultan of Lak&#363;ngan</li>
<li>7. Burh&#257;n</li>
<li>8. Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam</li>
<li>9. Bansw&#299;l</li>
<li>10. Sayid Wap&#257;t</li>
<li>11. Pak&#299;h</li>
<li>12. Mayt&#365;m</li>
</ul>
<p>These two orders represent the best opinions of the <i>Saraya</i> or
upper valley, but there is no doubt that both of them are wrong. The
order of Sharif Ali is, generally speaking, nearer the truth. From an
examination of the records the following order seems the best of
all:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Raja Sir&#363;ngan</li>
<li>2. Datu Map&#363;ti</li>
<li>3. Tambingag</li>
<li>4. Datu Tap&#363;di</li>
<li>5. Baratamay</li>
<li>6. Sabaraba</li>
<li>7. M&#257;lang</li>
<li>8. Manuk</li>
<li>9. Sakandar</li>
<li>10. Mayt&#365;m</li>
</ul>
<p>Sultan K&#257;yib given by Sharif Ali probably is Baratamay. There
is no indication in the records that Tamay, Burh&#257;n,
Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam, and Bansw&#299;l were ever rajas of Bwayan, as
Sharif Afdal seems to think. The records that seem most reliable are
those in the possession of Datu Mast&#363;ra, which are herein
translated.</p>
<p>The missing link, as far as these records and the notes of the
author are concerned, is the relation between Sultan Mayt&#365;m and
his predecessors. Common opinion declares him to be a son of Pak&#299;r
Mawl&#257;na, but this does not seem probable, and it is certainly not
in the records of Magindanao, though these are reasonably accurate and
complete. Sharif Ali, in his list, makes no distinction between a
successor and a son; most people have the same idea, which is very
misleading, to say the least. From the facts obtainable it seems
probable that Sultan Mayt&#365;m was the son of either Sultan Sakandar
of Rak&#363;ngan or Datu Map&#363;ti, the uncle of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>Sakandar. This is corroborated by the fact that
the chief line of descent has been in the line of Datu Map&#363;ti, the
son of Raja Sir&#363;ngan, and his grandson, Sabaraba. The opinion of
the sheikh-a-datu of Mindanao is that Sultan Mayt&#365;m was the son of
Datu Map&#363;ti, who would be the most eligible to the succession.</p>
<p>Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam mentioned here is Sultan
Kah&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n Kuda of Magindanao. Sah&#299;d Wap&#257;t, or
Am&#299;ru-d-D&#299;n, is Sultan J&#257;par S&#257;dik Man&#257;mir of
Magindanao. Mup&#257;t Batwa is Sultan Dipatw&#257;n Anw&#257;r.
Pak&#299;h Mawl&#257;na Al&#299;mu-d-D&#299;n is Sultan Pak&#299;r
Mawl&#257;na Kayru-d-D&#299;n Kamza. Panglu is Sultan
Pak&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n.</p>
<p>From Sultan Mayt&#365;m down the succession is accurately known. The
sultanate has evidently been divided. Maraj&#257;nun or B&#257;ngun,
the older brother, succeeded to Bwayan and all the country lying on the
left bank of the Pulangi and the Sapakan Rivers and all the country
between Sapakan and the lakes of Ligwasan and Bulawan. B&#257;yaw,
known as the sultan of Kudarangan, succeeded to Kudarangan and all the
northern half of the sultanate.</p>
<p>Datu &#362;t&#363; succeeded his father, Maraj&#257;nun, and lived
first at Bwayan. After the Terrero campaign of 1886 he moved to
Sapakan. His full name is Sultan Anw&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n
&#362;t&#363;.</p>
<p>The sultan of Kudarangan was succeeded by his son, the sultan of
Tambilawan. Tambilawan is the name of the sultan&rsquo;s residence and
lies on the right bank of the Rio Grande a short distance above
Kudarangan. The sultan of Tambilawan is a weak leader, and the chief
power of the land has fallen to his brother, Datu Ali, who is a noted
warrior among the Moros.</p>

<p>This book gives the genealogy of the descendants of the Apostle of
God who came into Magindanao. It is learned that the Apostle of God
begot P&#257;tima Zuhrah, who begot Sar&#299;p<a class="noteref" id=

Sar&#299;p Husayn. The latter begot Sar&#299;p

Sar&#299;p Akmad; Sar&#299;p Ali Zayna-l-&#256;bid&#299;n.</p>
<p>Sar&#299;p Zayna-l-&#256;bid&#299;n came to Juh&#363;r and heard
that the sultan of Juh&#363;r, Sultan Sulkarnayn, had a daughter called
Putri J&#363;sul &#256;sik&#299;n. The Sar&#299;p married Putri
J&#363;sul &#256;sik&#299;n and begot Sar&#299;p Kabungsuwan. As
Sar&#299;p Kubungsuwan grew up and reached maturity he obtained his
father&rsquo;s permission and set out on a sea voyage with a large
number of followers from Juh&#363;r. As they got out to the open sea
they unfurled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>their sails to make speed, but a very strong wind
blew and scattered them in all directions, so that they lost track of
one another. As a result Sar&#299;p Kabungsuwan arrived at Magindanao.
The others scattered to Bulunay (Bruney), K&#363;ran, Tamp&#257;suk,
Sandakan, Palimbang, Bangjar, S&#363;lug, T&#365;b&#365;k, and
Malabang.</p>
<p>Sar&#299;p Kabungsuwan anchored at Nat&uacute;bakan, at the mouth of
the Rio Grande. Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu directed some people of
Magindanao to carry their net for them and went down to the mouth of
the river. There they met Sar&#299;p Kabungsuwan, and Tabunaway sent
Mam&#257;lu up the river to bring down all the men of Magindanao. After
the arrival of the men Tabunaway invited Kabungsuwan to accompany him
to Magindanao. Kabungsuwan refused to accompany them unless they became
Moslems. Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu then repeated their invitation and
all of them promised to become Moslems. Kabungsuwan insisted that he
would not land at all unless they came together then and there and were
washed and became Mohammedans. This they did, and on account of the
bathing at that place they changed its name to Paygw&#257;n.</p>
<p>Kabungsuwan then accompanied Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu, and the men
towed them up all the way from Tinundan to Magindanao. Thus Kabungsuwan
converted to Islam all the people of Magindanao, Matampay, Slangan,
Simway, and Katitw&#257;n.</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival in Magindanao Sar&#299;p Kabungsuwan married
Putri Tun&#299;na, whom Mam&#257;lu found inside a stalk of bamboo.
This occurred at the time Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu were cutting bamboo
to build their fish corral. As Mam&#257;lu, who was felling the bamboo
tree returned, Tabunaway inquired whether all the tree was felled or
not. Mam&#257;lu answered that all the tree was felled except one young
stalk. Tabunaway then said, &ldquo;Finish it all, because it omens ill
to our fish corral to leave that one alone.&rdquo; Mam&#257;lu struck
it and it fell down, and there came out of it a child who was called
Putri Tun&#299;na. Her little finger was wounded, for the bolo had cut
through the bamboo.</p>
<p>Some time later Sar&#299;p Kabungsuwan and Putri Tun&#299;na begot
three children&mdash;Putri M&#257;m&#363;r, Putri M&#299;lagandi, and
Bay Bat&#363;la. Putri M&#257;m&#363;r married
M&#257;lang-sa-Ing&#365;d, the datu of Bwayan.
M&#257;lang-sa-Ing&#365;d died later, and Pulwa, his brother, came down
to Magindanao and married the widow of his elder brother, Putri
M&#257;m&#363;r.</p>
<p>M&#257;lang-sa-Ing&#365;d and Pulwa were the children of Budtul.
Budtul was the son of Mam&#363;, the first datu of Bwayan.</p>
<p>Pulwa and Putri M&#257;m&#363;r begot Raja Sir&#363;ngan, who was
the first raja of Bwayan. Raja Sir&#363;ngan begot Datu Map&#363;ti,
Tambingag, Tangkwag, and the daughters Kdaw, Ban&#299;tik,
Malil&#365;mb&#365;n, Duni, and L&#299;bu.</p>
<p>Datu Map&#363;ti begot two daughters, Gimbul&#257;nan and Gawang.
Gawang married Datu Tap&#363;di of Tawlan and begot Sabaraba and a
daughter, Dumbay. Dumbay begot Tamay, who married a concubine and begot
L&#299;nug-Bulawan and the daughters N&#257;nun, Pinay&#363;, Antanu,
and Putri. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sabaraba begot Datu Map&#363;ti and M&#257;lang, who was Raja
Bwayan, in Bwayan. M&#257;lang begot Sakandar, who was sultan of
Rak&#363;ngan.</p>
<p>Tambingag begot Burh&#257;n and the daughters Kal&#299;ma, Tambil,
and S&#299;nal. S&#299;nal married Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam, who was
treacherously murdered. She bore Bansw&#299;l and K&#365;ning.
K&#365;ning was married to Sah&#299;d Wap&#257;t and begot Pak&#299;h
Mawl&#257;na and Pangl&#363;, who was Mup&#257;t Hid&#257;yat, and the
daughters Sal&#299;lang, entitled Baya-l&#257;bi, and Gindul&#363;ngan,
who was the mother of Baya-l&#257;bi of Lak&#363;ngan.</p>
<p>Tangkwag begot Mukarna and Buntang, who was the son of a
concubine.</p>
<p>Kdaw was married to Makad&#363;l&#363; and begot Baratamay and
B&#257;ni. Makad&#363;l&#363; begot also Undung and Nawang by a
concubine.</p>
<p>Baratamay married Gimbul&#257;nan and begot Lalan&#363;, entitled
Baya Budtung, who married Sultan Baraham&#257;n and died without
offspring; she was overshadowed by Panabwan, a lady of Tajiman.</p>
<p>Baratamay and B&#257;ni were both born of a princess; so one day
Baratamay said to B&#257;ni, &ldquo;You rule Bwayan, for I am going
away and shall be absent,&rdquo; and Baratamay left for S&#363;lug.
There he married a lady of S&#363;lug and begot Pangyan Ampay. Some
time after that Baratamay returned to the land of Bwayan and went up as
far as Bagu Ing&#365;d. There he married a lady of Bagu Ing&#365;d and
begot Mun&#257;wal and Gangga. Mun&#257;wal married Mup&#257;t Batwa
and begot Manuk, Raja Bwayan in Bagu Ing&#365;d. Manuk begot Manman,
Tap&#363;di, and Raja M&#363;da of Matingawan. Manman was sultan of
Bagu Ing&#365;d.</p>
<p>Baratamay begot also Tunt&#363;, who begot Dungk&#365;lang, a datu
of Kabul&#363;kan, and Ambuludtu, and Ugu N&#299;ga; also
Pandal&#299;g&#365;n, Anib, K&#257;baw, Manab&#363;,
Talib&#363;b&#363;, D&#257;naw, and the daughters G&#257;yang and
T&#365;ndwan. These were all the children of Baratamay&mdash;in all,
fourteen.</p>

<p class="first">This manuscript is copied from a scroll written for
the sultan of Kudarangan by Twan Kali, a noted Moro judge who was in
the service of the sultan. It was obtained through the favor of Sharif
Afdal, the son-in-law of the late sultan.</p>
<p>The few books or documents belonging to the family of Bwayan or
Kudarangan that I have seen are neat and well written. The dialect
spoken in Saraya differs a little from that of Magindanao, but in the
main they are one and the same dialect. This manuscript is strictly
Magindanao in its dialect and in its style. The first two pages of this
copy give the genealogy of Kabungsuwan from Mohammed and Adam; it is
similar to that of Manuscripts Nos. I and II, and ends with Putri

Kabungsuwan, who married Pulwa, the first Mohammedan datu of
Bwayan.</p>
<p>The second part gives the descendants of Pulwa and the genealogy of
the rajas of Bwayan. This is, however, incomplete and deficient. It
stops at the seventh generation, which is practically midway, and does
not distinctly state who were the rajas of Bwayan.</p>
<p>It is fuller than Manuscript No. II in giving the descendants of all
the sons of Raja Sir&#363;ngan, but it does not proceed in the main
line of descent as far and as fully as Manuscript No. II. The original
scroll from which this copy was taken is evidently older than Datu
Mast&#363;ra&rsquo;s copy.</p>

<h5 class="main">Introduction</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This manuscript is a correct copy of the original
which is in the possession of Datu Kali Adam of Kalangnan, one of the
principal present representatives of the <i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i>. The
<i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i> are a distinct class of the Moros of
Magindanao who trace their origin back to the former chiefs of the
country who reigned before the introduction of Mohammedanism. The
original was written by Datu Kali Adam himself, copied from a previous
manuscript handed down to him from his father, who was a prominent
judge, with some later additions of his own. It was neither neat nor
well kept. It abounds with grammatical mistakes and has several errors
in the text. Its style is mixed; Ranao words, pronouns, and
terminations occur; still, in general it is a fair specimen of the
literature of the Magindanao dialect. It is the best authority on its
subject, and is greatly valued by the people. It is the oldest
manuscript known on this subject.</p>
<p>The ruler of Magindanao at the time of Kabungsuwan&rsquo;s arrival
was Tabunaway. Tabunaway was not a datu; he was a <i>timuway</i>. The
word <i>timuway</i> or <i>timway</i> means chief or leader, and is
still generally used by the Tirurays and Manobos and other hill tribes.
Kabungsuwan evidently conquered Magindanao, and its sovereignty passed
over from Tabunaway to him, and to his descendants after him. The Moros
greatly regard and respect every Mohammedan who is related to the
Prophet, and look upon every Arabian as of noble birth and equal in
rank to their datu class. Descent from Kabungsuwan constitutes all
their claim to nobility and their right to the datuship.</p>
<p>The descendants of Tabunaway are naturally jealous. They claim to
have come from an Arabian ancestor who is descended from the Prophet,
and take great pride in the fact. They assert that the datus omitted
this part of the history from their books intentionally in order to
give more importance to Kabungsuwan and to their own descent.</p>
<p>The descendants of Tabunaway are called <i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i>,
which is the future tense of the verb <i>d&#257;t&#363;</i>. The
<i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i> are well known, and I have met several of
them. Chief among them I mention Datu Mawl&#257;na Sa-Magindanao and
Datu Kali Adam. The former has lately been favored <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>with the
honorary title of datu by Datu Mast&#363;ra, because his mother was a
datu&rsquo;s daughter and he personally deserved the honor. Both Datu
Mawl&#257;na and Datu Kali claim that Sharif Maraja, the father of
Tabunaway, was an uncle of Sharif Kabungsuwan and that he and his
children were Mohammedans prior to the arrival of Kabungsuwan, though
their people were not so until Kabungsuwan converted them. The story
that the angels brought paradise to Mindanao does not appear in the
other manuscripts, but it is generally believed by all the datus and
people of Magindanao. I heard both Datu Mast&#363;ra and Datu
Mawl&#257;na Sa-Magindanao affirm the fact. They say that a part of the
white earth of paradise was left in the hill behind Cotabato and they
call it the sacred dust. It was the custom in Magindanao to bring this
earth before the new sultan after his appointment that he might step on
it for the confirmation of his sultanate. They believed no sultan could
be successful and prosperous in his reign unless he performed this
rite. The last sultan who obeyed this custom was Sultan Untung
Qudratul-L&#257;h, Datu Mast&#363;ra&rsquo;s father, during the latter
part of whose reign the Spaniards came into Magindanao and occupied
Cotabato. The later three sultans did not perform this rite; this the
Moros cite as the cause of the decline of the sultans&rsquo; power and
the lack of prosperity in the country. They believe this white earth
still exists in the hill of Cotabato, but nobody can find it except the
oldest living <i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i> whose forefathers have not
intermarried with either datus or the common people, and to whom the
secret has been handed down from Tabunaway. This they keep away from
everybody except their children. The <i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i> are a
privileged class of people, and claim they can follow any datu they
choose, and that they should not pay any tribute. They assert that when
Tabunaway resigned his sovereignty in favor of his older brother,
Kabungsuwan, he reserved this privilege for his children, which
privilege Kabungsuwan promised to respect.</p>
<p>For these reasons the <i>dum&#257;t&#363;s</i> keep their own
records of the history of their country, and the genealogy of their
line.</p>
<p>Samb&#365;g, who is mentioned here, is stated to be the son of
Tabunaway. Manuscript No. III states that Kabungsuwan had a son named
Sambgan, who was born in Juh&#363;r. Whether these two are one and the
same name or not it is very difficult to say. Probably they are two
different names.</p>

<p class="first">The land of paradise was brought by the angels from
the west (Arabia) to Mindanao. Later the angels moved paradise to
Madinat, but the earth did not balance and tipped on the side of
Mindanao. They then measured the earth to find its center, but it had
none. Then the angels took paradise and carried it to Mecca, but a part
of it remained in Mindanao.</p>
<p>Sharif Awliya knew that and came to Mindanao to search for it. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>saw a column of smoke, and as he came to this
smoke he found that it was a woman. He took her and married her and
begot a daughter whose name was Paramis&uacute;li, whom he left in the
blessed land.</p>
<p>Afterwards there came from Juh&#363;r Sharif Hasan and Sharif
Maraja, who were brothers. Sharif Hasan came to Sulu, and from him
descended all the datus of Sulu. Sharif Maraja had two sons, Sharif
Bidayan and Sharif Timbangan. He or one of his sons lived at Basilan.
Sharif Hasan and Sharif Maraja were followed by Sharif Kabungsuwan, a
nephew of Sharif Maraja. Sharif Maraja was the first Mohammedan who
came to Bawangin, which is Mindanao. He first came to Slangan (the
western part of Cotabato), where he saw <i>Burak</i> (an animal
intermediate between a bird and a horse) light on a bamboo tree.
<i>Burak</i> slipped and let fall his load, which was the lady,
Paramis&uacute;li. Sharif Maraja dived into the river and brought up
Paramis&uacute;li; later he married her and begot several children. The
oldest of his children was Tabunaway, the youngest Mam&#257;lu. The
daughters were Sarab&#257;nun and Pindaw.</p>
<p>Some time after that Sharif Kabungsuwan came from Juh&#363;r and
anchored at Tinundan (a stream or estuary very near the mouth of the
Rio Grande of Mindanao). There was nobody there then; but the sharif
saw a <i>taro</i> plant and a cornstalk floating down, and said,
&ldquo;There must be some people at the head of this river; let us wait
until they come down.&rdquo; Later there came down the river
Man&uacute;mbali, the datu of Slangan, with seven men, to fish at
Tinundan. They saw Sharif Kabungsuwan. The sharif called them, but they
could not understand him. He beckoned to them, but one of them died on
that account, and they were frightened and returned. Later the people
of Katittwan, having heard of this, came down the river to see the
sharif, but they also could not understand him, and one of their men
died of the same cause. They again returned and told Tabunaway, who
came down the river and saw Sharif Kabungsuwan. The sharif called to
Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu, who both understood him and came into his
boat. Tabunaway saw the ring of Sharif Kabungsuwan, and the sharif
observed the ring of Tabunaway. The sharif then asked Tabunaway how he
had become possessed of this ring, and if he had bought or inherited
it. Tabunaway replied that he had not bought the ring, but that he had
inherited it. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the sharif, &ldquo;you must be a
descendant of my uncle.&rdquo; He then informed Tabunaway of his
relation to him, and they became acquainted with each other. They then
went up the river together in the boat of Sharif Kabungsuwan and came
to Magindanao (which is Cotabato). There Kabungsuwan met
Sarab&#257;nun, the sister of Tabunaway, and asked to marry her.
Tabunaway consented and the sharif married Sarab&#257;nun, but she died
before her child was born.</p>
<p>After the death of his father Tabunaway became datu of
Magindanao.</p>
<p>Sitti Paramis&uacute;li, the mother of Tabunaway, had asked her son
to bury her comb, after her death, underneath her window. This he did.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>comb grew and become a large bamboo tree. As
Mam&#257;lu was cutting the tree one day he found a lady in one of the
bamboo joints which he had cut. The blow had reached her little finger
and cut it slightly. He took the child to Tabunaway who told
Mam&#257;lu to adopt her because he had no children. They called her
Putri Tun&#299;na, because they thought their mother had come to life
again. As she was a virgin and of age she was married to Sharif
Kabungsuwan and bore three daughters. The first daughter was called
Mamuranda, and married Pulwa, the datu of Bwayan. The second was called
Milagandi, and married M&#257;lang-sa-Ing&#365;d, who is also a datu of
Bwayan. The third daughter was called Putri Bat&#363;la.</p>
<p>Samb&#365;g, the son of Tabunaway, married and begot Dagansina.
Dagansina begot Ampan; Ampan begot Alang; Alang begot Dum&#257;ya, who
married Duyuttanan, who is from Liy&aacute;min in Balabagan.
Dum&#257;ya begot Lawana and Mandawa and Taluwa. Lawana begot Bansara.
Bansara begot Iput and Ibr&#257;h&#299;m and Jubayr and the following
daughters: Lamyuna, Kal&#299;ma, and Malubay, the mother of Sultan Izra
of Ram&#299;tan. From Lamyuna descended Mohammed, whose children are
Gayag and Sakandar and Undang. Kal&#299;ma bore Antim. Antim begot
Jayra and Tunug.</p>
<p>Iput begot Karija. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m begot Ugu. Ugu begot Mintal and
Umar, one of whom was a judge (<i>kali</i>). The judge begot
Ruran&#365;n and Gansing and Mam&#257;lu and a daughter called Mandi.
Kali Ruran&#365;n begot Nyaw and Tarawya and Mangilay. Mam&#257;lu

<p class="first">This manuscript is a copy of the original which is in
the possession of Datu Kali Adam of Kalangnan mentioned in the previous
manuscript (No. IV). It is written partly in the Mindanao dialect and
partly in Malay. It refers to three subjects and comprises three
distinct parts.</p>
<p>The first part includes the first three pages and three lines of the
fourth page. The first two pages are written in the Mindanao dialect
and the rest in Malay. It gives the genealogy of many of the Iranun
datus, but is very ambiguous and lacks interest. The Malay part is
written by the same Mindanao author, no doubt, and is neither correctly
written nor clear. This part has no special interest except for the
student who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>desires to investigate the oldest records
referring to the origin of the ruling datus of the country.</p>
<p>The second part is much more interesting. It is the oldest record on
hand referring to the genealogy of Magindanao proper with distinct
information as to the source from which it was obtained. It is all in
Malay, but it is so poorly written and composed that its translation is
a very difficult task. Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na, the authority this book
claims, was one of the most intelligent sultans Magindanao had. The
substance of this text was transmitted in Malay by Pak&#299;r
Mawl&#257;na himself to Capt. Thomas Forest in the year 1775. It
appears that there have always been in Mindanao natives who could
converse and write in Malay. The statement of Captain Forest would lead
one to infer that the book from which Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na
translated was written in the native dialect, and not in Malay.
Probably the text of this manuscript is not identical with that of
Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na&rsquo;s copy, but derived from the same source
and written in Malay instead of Magindanao. Its text is by no means as
reliable as that of Manuscript No. VI, but it gives some very
interesting information which is not mentioned in the other copies.
Sultan Baraham&#257;n, to whom the principal source and authority of
the <i>tarsila</i> is referred, was the fifth grandson of Sar&#299;p
Kabungsuwan and the first grandson of Sultan Qudrat, the famous
Corralat of Comb&eacute;s. He had several children who figured
prominently in the history of the country, four of whom are quoted here
as authorities, and who are surnamed Sah&#299;d Wap&#257;t, Wap&#257;t
Batwa, Jarn&#299;k, and Sumannap. Their full and exact titles were
Sultan J&#257;par S&#257;dik Man&#257;mir, Sultan Dipatw&#257;n
Anw&#257;r, G&#363;g&#363; Jarn&#299;k, and Datu Ma-as <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1879" title="Source: Sum&aacute;nnap">Sumannap</span>.
Man&#257;mir was assassinated by his nephew, Mal&#299;nug, and is
always referred to as Sah&#299;d Wap&#257;t, which means, in Arabic,
&ldquo;Dead Martyr.&rdquo; Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam, the brother of
Baraham&#257;n, is Sultan Mohammed Kah&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n Kuda, who
usurped the sultanate after the death of his brother. Pak&#299;h
Mawl&#257;na Amiru D&#299;n was the eldest son of Sah&#299;d
Wap&#257;t, and his correct full title was Sultan Pak&#299;r
Mawl&#257;na Mohammed Kayru-d-D&#299;n Kamza. He is generally referred
to as Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na, and is sometimes called Pak&#299;h
instead of Pak&#299;r.</p>
<p>Though the text of this manuscript varies from that of No. VI, it
very often mentions facts and names that are lacking in the latter and
which help to complete the sense and the subject-matter of the
<i>tarsila</i>. The first two words of the address Paduk Sari Sultan do
not belong to the Mindanao dialect, but are Malay. This <i>tarsila</i>
ends with the children of Baraham&#257;n and Jam&#257;lu-l-&#256;lam,
and evidently belongs to the period prior to the death of Pak&#299;r
Mawl&#257;na, or his name and those of his brothers would otherwise
have been mentioned.</p>
<p>The third part is written in the Magindanao dialect and comprises
the twelfth and thirteenth pages only. It shows the exact ancestral
relation that exists between the ruling datus of Magindanao and the
Iranun datus, and throws considerable light upon the nature and the
tribal characteristics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>of the datuships or Moro communities. The
principal ancestors of the sultans of Ram&#299;tan, Tubuk, Dissan, and
Tapurug were Umang N&#257;gu, Anta, and Umbun, respectively, and they
were the grandchildren of Dimasangkay, the brother of Kapitan Lawut
Bw&#299;san, whose descendants are the sultans of Magindanao.
Ram&#299;tan lies a little north of Baras and Malabang. Tubuk is the
principal district in the immediate vicinity of Malabang. Dissan lies
on the north shore of Lake Lanao.</p>
<p>Being mainly written in Malay, this manuscript is of no literary
value at all. That part of it written in the Magindanao dialect shows a
slight admixture of the Iranun dialect. Both its composition and style
are poor, and mistakes in spelling and writing abound.</p>

<p class="first">This manuscript is a copy of the original which is in
the possession of Datu Mast&#363;ra, the best-informed datu of
Magindanao, and the son of Sultan Qudrat Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam
Untung, the greatest of the late sultans of Magindanao. Datu
Mast&#363;ra has the best collection of Magindanao books and records
and owns the most reliable of the royal documents that have been
preserved. This copy is one of the best specimens of Magindanao
literature extant. It is principally genealogy and speaks briefly of
the early history of Magindanao and the rise of its sultanate, its main
purpose being to preserve the record of descent and determine the right
of succession to the sultanate.</p>
<p>The first page describes the birth of Putri Tun&#299;na and her
relation to Tabunaway, the ruler of Magindanao. The second page
describes the coming of Sharif Kabungsuwan to Magindanao, his
conversion of Mindanao to Islam, and his marriage to Putri Tun&#299;na.
The third page gives an account of Kabungsuwan&rsquo;s marriage to a
princess from Malabang and his descendants from her. The rest of the
manuscript is a detailed account of births and descendants down to the
birth of the great grandfather of the present sultan, which must have
occurred shortly before the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is
the most complete and the most nearly correct copy that exists. It is
written at a later period than that of No. V, and covers two later
generations. The history and genealogy of the nineteenth century were
obtained by personal investigation and inquiry from the oldest and most
reliable datus and other persons living. Diagrams Nos. 3 and 4 show the
descent of the rulers of Magindanao from Kabungsuwan to the present
time.</p>

succession are as follows:</p>

<p class="first">IN THE NAME OF GOD THE COMPASSIONATE AND MERCIFUL.
PRAISE BE TO GOD THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE. I HAVE FULL SATISFACTION
THAT GOD IS MY WITNESS</p>
<p>This book speaks of the origin of the rulers of Magindanao. The
first known rulers were Tabunaway and his brother Mam&#257;lu. One day
they were cutting bamboo to build a fish corral. Mam&#257;lu cut down
all the trees except one small stalk that was left standing alone.
Tabunaway then called to Mam&#257;lu, &ldquo;Finish it up, because it
omens ill to our fish corral.&rdquo; Mam&#257;lu therefore cut it and
found in it a girl whose little finger was slightly cut by a slip of
the bolo. He carried the girl to Tabunaway, but Tabunaway told him to
keep her and adopt her as his child. This girl was named by Tabunaway
Putri Tun&#299;na.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there came out from Mecca Sharif Ali
Zayna-l-Abid&#299;n, who proceeded to Bawangin (Malaysia) and settled
at Juh&#363;r. Here he married the daughter of Sultan Iskandar
Thul-Qarnayn of Juh&#363;r, whose name was J&#363;sul &#256;siqin, and
begot Sharif Kabungsuwan. Sharif Kabungsuwan came to Magindanao to the
mouth of the Tinundan. There he met Tabunaway and accompanied him to
the town of Magindanao. This is Sharif Kabungsuwan, who converted to
Islam all the people of Magindanao, Slangan, Matampay, Lusud,
Katittw&#257;n, and Simway, and who was followed by all those who
accepted Islam in the land of Magindanao.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that Tabunaway married Sharif Kabungsuwan to the
girl that was found inside the bamboo stalk, whose name was Putri
Tun&#299;na. To them were born three daughters&mdash;Putri
M&#257;m&#363;r, who married M&#257;lang-sa-Ing&#365;d, an older
brother of Pulwa; Putri M&#299;lagandi, who married Pulwa, the datu of
Bwayan; and Putri Bay Bat&#363;la, who had no children.</p>
<p>Later Sharif Kabungsuwan married Angint&#257;bu, the daughter of
Maka-ap&#365;n, a coast datu of Malabang, and begot Sharif
Maka-alang.</p>
<p>Sharif Maka-alang married B&#365;li, a Bilan woman who was found by
Par&#257;sab in a crow&rsquo;s egg. There were born to them a boy
called Bangk&#257;ya and a girl called Maginut.</p>
<p>Bangk&#257;ya married a woman of Magindanao and begot Dimasangkay.
He also married a woman of Matampay and begot G&#363;g&#363;
Sarik&#363;la. Later he married &#362;mb&#365;n of Slangan and begot
Kapitan L&#257;wut Bw&#299;san and Tagsan and Pinwis.</p>
<p>Dimasangkay married a Simway woman and begot B&#363;tu-na Samal, who
had no offspring, and &#362;man, a woman. He married also &#364;mpas,
the sister of Sandab, and begot &#364;mb&#363;rung, who was not well
known.</p>
<p>G&#363;g&#363; Sarik&#363;la married Raja Putri, a S&#363;lug lady,
who gave birth to Putri Mampay. He also married the sister of
Dasum&#257;lung of Linilw&#257;n and begot G&#257;wu.</p>
<p>Kapitan L&#257;wut Bw&#299;san married Ambang, the daughter of
Dalamba of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=

and Arawaldi.</p>
<p>Dundang Tidulay married Param&#257;ta &#256;siya, a Bitalan lady,
and begot Putri Gunung L&#299;dang, who was the first Bayal&#257;bi of
Magindanao and who had no offspring. His children from a concubine were

<h5 class="main">Introduction</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sultanate of Bagumbayan occupies the middle ground
between the Saylud or lower Rio Grande Valley and the Saraya or upper
Rio Grande Valley. It is located at the head of the delta, and really
comprises the upper part of the Saylud, and lies mainly along the banks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>of the southern branch of the Rio Grande. It
extends as far down the banks of the southern Rio Grande as the upper
borders of Tamontaka, and as far down as Libungan, along the banks of
the northern branch of the Rio Grande. Its upper limit is Maysawa, a
little above the Kakar or canal.</p>
<p>The present sultan, Abu-Bakar, lives at Bagumbayan proper, which is
located on the right bank of the southern Rio Grande about 3 miles
below Tambao or the fork. He is still addressed, at times, as the
sultan of Talak&#363;k&#363;, which was the proper address of his
father, named after the older name of the capital. The word
<i>Bagumbayan</i> means &ldquo;newly built,&rdquo; and has lately been
applied to the sultanate on account of the late change of the residence
of the sultan. Talak&#363;k&#363; is the word that appears in all
Spanish records and histories. Kabuntalan is still older and is more
used by the Moros themselves. The old site of Kabuntalan was on the
left bank of the main river just above the fork. It has been completely
abandoned.</p>
<p>Nagtangan is the oldest name and the one which appears first in this
manuscript.</p>
<p>This manuscript is copied from the original, which is in the
possession of the sultan himself. It was obtained through the favor of
Datu Balabadan, who is a relative of the sultan and who belongs to the
same family or an allied branch of the same.</p>
<p>The original is a very old copy and many of the leaves and margins
are torn and have fallen into pieces. The handwriting is fair and
plain, but the composition and grammar are very poor. The
orthographical errors committed in writing Moro names in Arabic
characters are very numerous and greatly change the expression of the
words. It is evident that the original author was a poor writer, and
did not have the usual practical knowledge in writing in Arabic
characters that other Moro authors had.</p>
<p>The dialect is strictly that of Magindanao. The titles of the datus
are similar to those used in Magindanao. Two new titles, Jukul&#257;nu
and J&#299;wana, appear often, and in all probability are applied to
subdatus of the same rank as G&#363;g&#363;, Umar Maya, Mar&#257;ja
Layla, etc.</p>

<h5 class="main">The History of Bagumbayan.</h5>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The two greatest powers that figured prominently in
the Rio Grande Valley are the sultan of Magindanao and the raja of
Bwayan. These rulers have at all times been considered as greater in
power and higher in rank than any other ruler in the valley. In the
latter part of the eighteenth century and during the main part of the
nineteenth century the sultan of Kabuntalan also figured prominently
and held a very intimate relation and a close position to both of the
other sultans, which position he still holds at the present time.</p>
<p>It appears that the first ruler of Kabuntalan was Dik&#257;ya, the
son of a raja Bwayan, who simply held the honorary title of datu. His
successor had no male heir, and one of his daughters, Babak, married
Umar Maya Tubu-tubu of Magindanao, who became ruler of Kabuntalan and
whose son was the first mentioned sultan there. This makes the line of
descent of Kabuntalan related by Babak to the line of Bwayan and by
Umar Maya to that of Magindanao. This relation to both Magindanao and
Bwayan and the intermediate position Kabuntalan holds to both Saylud
and Saraya have been very prominent factors in the history-making
events of the valley, and have successively been taken advantage of by
both Spanish and American authorities managing the affairs of the
country.</p>
<p>Diagram No. 5 gives in a very explicit and clear manner the names of
the rulers of Kabuntalan or Bagumbayan, the order of their descent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>and succession, and the relation they hold to each
other. Their names in the order of precedence are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Datu Dik&#257;ya</li>
<li>2. Datu D&#365;ka</li>
<li>3. Datu Umar Maya</li>
<li>4. Sultan Digra Alam</li>
<li>5. Sultan Mohammed Al&#299;mu-d-D&#299;n</li>
<li>6. Sultan sa-Baraham&#257;n</li>
<li>7. Sultan Mohammed Iskandar Man&#257;mir</li>
<li>8. Sultan Iskandar Sul-Karnayn</li>
<li>9. Sultan Idr&#299;s</li>
<li>10. Sultan Abu Bakar</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram shows also the principal relations of Bagumbayan to
Bwayan and to Magindanao.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the early history of Kabuntalan. Datu
Kali Ibrahim, who is the chief judge of Bagumbayan, told the following
story:</p>
<p>Soon after the arrival of Dik&#257;ya in Kabuntalan the chief people
of the village took their new datu in a boat on a little excursion.
When they had gone some distance from the village they engaged in a
sham fight and one party attacked the datu. This affair was prearranged
and planned to test the courage and power of their datu. They made
their attack with krises and bamboo lances. Dik&#257;ya was frightened
and ran away. The people lost respect for him and expelled him from the
village. Some time later he won their friendship by his good behavior
and was reinstated as datu of Kabuntalan.</p>
<p>The statement on page 47 that Dik&#257;ya was the son of Pulwa was
taken from the Bwayan <i>tarsila</i> and is added on account of the
relation it bears to the subject. The part of the <i>tarsila</i> of
Bwayan which bears on this subject states that Dik&#257;ya was the son
of Pulwa by a concubine, and that Dik&#257;ya begot D&#365;ka, who
married Rantyan, a Malitigaw lady whose mother was Ag&#365;b. The
children of D&#365;ka and Rantyan were Bulus, Manalidt&#363;, Puwi, and
Miyandung.</p>
<p>As Pulwa must have lived about the year 1550, and as Digra Alam must
have ruled about the year 1770, the statement that D&#365;ka married
Ambun and begot Babak, the mother of Digra Alam, can not be accepted as
true. Some links in the list are evidently missing, but the fact is
that the right to rule Kabuntalan belonged to the descendants of
D&#365;ka, and was principally derived from Bwayan.</p>
<p>The first ruler of Kabuntalan addressed as sultan was Digra Alam,
the son of Umar Maya and Babak. Diagram No. 5 shows plainly that Digra
Alam must have ruled about the same time as Sultan Pak&#299;r
Mawl&#257;na Kanza of Mindanao, or his brother, Pak&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n,
that is about the year A. D. 1770.</p>
<p>In a treaty between the Spanish Government and the sultan of
Kabuntalan in the year 1857 the sultan is addressed as sultan of
Tambao. He must be either Sultan Iskandar Sul-Karnayn or Sultan
Idr&#299;s, probably the latter.</p>
<p>About midway between Tambao and Libungan on the left bank of the
river is a small monument, possibly a tomb, erected in memory of those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>who died during the fight between the Spaniards
and Sultan Idr&#299;s. In 1861 Tambao and Taviran or Tapidan were
occupied by the Spaniards. In 1884 Sultan Idr&#299;s submitted
unconditionally to the Spanish authorities and received their
protection against Datu &#362;t&#363;. Datu Ay&#363;nan of Taviran,
Datu Balabadan&rsquo;s brother, aided the Spanish authorities in the
war against Datu &#362;t&#363; and was one of the most prominent datus
of Talak&#363;k&#363; and Magindanao.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before the first mass was celebrated on the northern
shore of Mindanao mosques had been built on the fertile banks of the
Pulangi, and before Legaspi landed on Cebu Kabungsuwan had been
declared and acknowledged datu of Magindanao.</p>
<p>The Mohammedan conqueror of Mindanao was neither an admiral of a
fleet nor a leader of an army of regular troops. He had no nation back
of him to re&euml;nforce his battalions nor a royal treasury to support
his enterprise. His expedition was not prompted by mere chivalry or the
gallant adventures of discovery. He was not looking for a new route to
rich lands nor searching for spices and gold dust. The emigrant sought
a new land to live in, and trusted his fortune and success to the valor
of his crew and the influence of his witchcraft. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having a fair admixture of Malay blood in him and sufficient Arabian
energy and enthusiasm to push on, he came and conquered and soon found
himself at home in Mindanao as well as at Juh&#363;r. There was no
racial prejudice to contend against and the language of the new land
was akin to his own. But true to his religion, as he was true to his
ancestry, his faith suffered no defeat. No submission was accepted
without conversion, and no friendship was cultivated with the
unfaithful. He married in the land of his conquest, and the ties of
faith were soon strengthened by the ties of blood and kinship; and as
the first generation passed and the second generation followed, the
conqueror and the conquered became one in blood and sympathy, one in
faith, and one in purpose. A new dynasty which stood for Islam, for
progress, and for civilization arose on the ruins of barbarism and
heathenism. Savage and fierce as the Moros look, they are greatly
superior to the surrounding pagans who inhabit the hills and the
interior of Mindanao. Once their equals and kinsmen, they have vastly
surpassed them now and are pre&euml;minently above them. With
Mohammedanism came art and knowledge, and communication with the
outside world was established.</p>
<p>For four centuries two different agencies of civilization have been
at work in the Philippine Islands. One started in the north and worked
its way south, continually progressing and constantly growing in power
and improving in character. The other began in the south and extended
north, but it soon reached a definite limit, and like a tree stunted in
its growth it reverted to its wild nature and grew thorny and
fruitless. The first graft of the tree of Magindanao was not aided by
later irrigation. The first wave of immigration was not
re&euml;nforced, and with <span class="corr" id="xd21e2580" title=
"Source: en">an</span> ebb tide it lost most of its size and force.</p>
<p>The Moros of Mindanao figured very prominently in the history of the
Philippines. They were never united under one flag, but they formed
different sultanates, some of which attained considerable power and
fame. In the fullness of his glory, the sultan of Magindanao ruled over
the whole southern coast of Mindanao from Point Tugubum, east of Mati,
to Zamboanga, and beyond this latter point to the outskirts of Dapitan.
All the pagan tribes living around the Gulf of Davao and in the
Sarangani country, and all the Subanos west of Tukurun and Dapitan
submitted to his power and paid him tribute. In the upper Rio Grande
Valley the power of the rajas of Bwayan was felt and respected as far
as the watershed of the Cagayan Valley on the north and the
inaccessible slopes of Mount Apo on the east. The Ranao Moros
controlled the whole country and the seacoast west of Cagayan de
Misamis and north of the Illana Bay.</p>
<p>The large majority of the Moro sultanates are, however, small, and
have never been fully numbered or described. They generally represent
small divisions of territory and subdivisions of tribes, each under one
chief who calls himself sultan or datu. Nevertheless, tribal relations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>and language group these petty divisions into two
large distinct groups, the Magindanao and the Iranun. The Magindanao
group includes the majority of the tribes. The Iranun group is
restricted to the tribes living along the eastern coast of the Bay of
Illana from the point of Polloc to the neighborhood of Tukurun, and the
whole Ranao region lying between that line and the Bay of Iligan.</p>
<p>The Magindanao group is the greater of the two in number, in the
extent of its territory, and in fame. Indeed, all the Moros of
Mindanao, except the Iranun, were at one time under one influence and
were brought under the sole control of the sultan of Magindanao.</p>
<p>The Samal Moros, who are variously classified by different writers
and who are often mentioned as one of the main divisions of the Moros
of Mindanao, are really foreign to Mindanao and belong to a distinct
and separate group. Until recently they had never been independent, but
had lived under the protection of various datus, and always served the
datu for the protection he afforded them, or paid him tribute. They
were sea rovers and had no claim on territory anywhere. Lately they
have settled down on the Island of Basilan, the Sulu Archipelago, and
around the Zamboanga peninsula. The Samals were the latest of the Malay
people to arrive in the Philippine Islands. In fact, they are the only
Malay people of whom we have positive historical statement of
emigration from the Malay Peninsula to Sulu and Mindanao, and were in
all probability Mohammedans prior to their arrival in the Philippine
Islands. With the Magindanao and Iranun peoples it is different. They
were in the land and belonged to the native element of the country long
before their conversion to Islam.</p>
<p>Islam was successfully introduced and firmly established in Mindanao
by one man. This same man founded the sultanate of Magindanao and
reformed the whole system of government among his converts. His full
name was Sharif Mohammed Kabungsuwan, generally known as Sharif
Kabungsuwan.</p>
<p>Kabungsuwan was without doubt the greatest Mohammedan adventurer who
trod the soil of the island. But both the traditions of Magindanao and
its written records state that he was preceded by two pioneers, the
first of whom was Sharif Awliya. Awliya was universally regarded as a
relative and a predecessor of Kabungsuwan. His history is wrapped in
myths. He is said to have come to Mindanao in the air to search for
paradise, or that part of it which remained in Mindanao, and, while he
was looking for it on the hill of Tantawan (Cotabato), to have found a
houri who was sent to him from heaven. He married this houri and she
bore a daughter called Paramisuli. Later the sharif returned to the
west, but his wife and daughter remained in Magindanao.</p>
<p>The second arrival in Magindanao was Sharif Maraja, who married
Paramisuli and was thought to have begotten Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu,
who were the chiefs of Magindanao when Kabungsuwan arrived in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>land. Sharif Maraja is said to have had a brother
called Sharif Hasan, who accompanied him as far as Basilan, but who
stopped there and founded the sultanate of Sulu. Whether Bidayan, the
son of Sharif Hasan, who is mentioned in the fourth <i>tarsila</i>,
should be Bidin, the abbreviated form of Zainul-Abidin, who was the
first sultan of Sulu, it is not easy to say. No copy of the Sulu
genealogy has been obtained as yet, and no authoritative statement can
be made. But it is universally believed that the first sultan of Sulu
came from Basilan, and that the ancestors of the sultans of Bruney,
Sulu, and Magindanao were brothers.</p>
<p>Sharif Kabungsuwan was the son of Sharif Ali Zainul Abidin, a
descendant of the Prophet Mohammed who emigrated from Hadramut,
southern Arabia, to Juh&#363;r, Malay Peninsula. The sultan of
Juh&#363;r, was evidently a Mohammedan then, and was called Iskandar
Thul-Karnayn, the Arabic appellation of Alexander the Great. The word
&ldquo;Sharif&rdquo; is Arabic and means &ldquo;noble.&rdquo; It is a
title which is universally given to the descendants of the Prophet
Mohammed. The full title is &ldquo;Sayid Sharif,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;master and noble.&rdquo; The Arabians generally use the first
word, <i>Sayid</i>, alone, but the Moros have adopted the second. Being
highly respected on account of his ancestry, Zainul-Abidin was given
the hand of the sultan&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. Her name was
J&#363;sul Asiq&#299;n, a corrupted form of the Arabic name
&ldquo;Jawzul-&rsquo;Ashiq&#299;n.&rdquo; It is generally believed that
she bore three children, the youngest of whom was called Kabungsuwan.
The word &ldquo;Kabungsuwan&rdquo; is Malay and means &ldquo;the
youngest.&rdquo; The names of the two older brothers of Kabungsuwan
were variously given. They were not mentioned in the <i>tarsila</i> and
have been obtained from mere traditions. One authority gave them as
Ahmad and Alawi, the other as Mohammed and Ahmad. Both authorities
agreed on the fact that the oldest founded the sultanate of Bruney, and
the second the sultanate of Sulu.</p>
<p>Kabungsuwan probably knew some Arabic, but he necessarily spoke and
used the Malay language, his mother&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
<p>The incidents connected with his departure from Juh&#363;r are of
considerable historical interest. No dates have been obtained relative
to this departure. The early Moros never dated their events or
documents. Their narratives were very brief and crude. When they dated
their events or wars they used a cycle of eight years, and designated
its years by the letters A, H, J, Z, D&prime;, B, W, D&Prime;. Whenever
one cycle ended they began another without any relation or reference to
the corresponding Mohammedan year. The earliest date that has been
obtained which has immediate bearing on Mindanao history is that
Bw&#299;san, the father of the Corralat of Comb&eacute;s, was living in
1597; the next date was that of Corralat&rsquo;s defeat by General
Corcuera in 1636. Bw&#299;san had two older brothers, and he was
probably preceded in the sultanate by both of them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>His
father, Bangk&#257;ya, was the son of Makaalang, the son of
Kabungsuwan. It will therefore be within safe limits to say that
Kabungsuwan&rsquo;s departure from Juh&#363;r or his arrival in
Mindanao occurred about the end of the fifteenth or the beginning of
the sixteenth century. Captain Forest, who visited Magindanao in 1775,
placed that event roughly at A. D. 1475, which is near enough to assume
as correct.</p>
<p><i>Tarsila</i> No. II states that there departed with Sharif
Kabungsuwan from Juh&#363;r many people who were dispersed by the storm
and ultimately found their way to different ports. The places to which
they went were Balimbang, Bangjar, Kuran, Tampasuk, Bruney, Sandakan,
Sulu, Malabang, Tubuk, and Mindanao. There is no doubt that this
statement refers to an emigration from Juh&#363;r east as far as
Mindanao, and that with this emigration came Kabungsuwan. The Samal
people generally believe that they came from Juh&#363;r and its
neighborhood. The traditions of Magindanao distinctly state that the
people who came with Kabungsuwan were Samals. The Samals or Bajaws are
the sea nomads of the Malay Archipelago and their emigrations are
frequent.</p>
<p>The Samals of the Sulu Archipelago are ruled by the Sulu datus and
are generally very submissive. They are allowed to live on Sulu soil,
but they have never made themselves independent anywhere. Indeed, all
the evidence that can be obtained seems to point distinctly to the fact
that they are of late arrival and do not belong to the older peoples of
the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>The early Magindanao records give the impression that the arrival of
Kabungsuwan and the conversion of the people of Magindanao to Islam
were accomplished peaceably. The word <i>Samal</i> is never mentioned
and the Samals are always considered as aliens in every respect. The
Samals seem never to have settled in Magindanao itself, but they did
settle for some time on the Island of Bongo or Bungud, that lies
opposite the mouth of the Pulangi, and at Batwan and Banago, near
Malabang. From these places they moved later to Sibugay and Sarangani
and the Gulf of Davao. Comb&eacute;s called the Samals <i>Lutaw</i> and
said that they were in the employ of Corralat, and manned some of his
boats, fighting and carrying on piracy side by side with the people of
Magindanao and with the Iranun. Summing up the preceding evidence, we
can unhesitatingly say that the Samals came to Magindanao with
Kabungsuwan, but that they did not settle on the soil of Magindanao,
nor did they intermarry sufficiently to assimilate with the Magindanao
people.</p>
<p>The character of the conquest Kabungsuwan achieved and the bearing
it has on the admixture of races in Mindanao is therefore of special
interest. When Kabungsuwan arrived at the mouth of the Pulangi there
were on the neighboring soil of Magindanao the following settlements:
Slangan, Magindanao proper, Lusud, Matampay, Tagiman, and Katitwan. The
first and the last were probably the greatest and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>strongest of all, for they were the first to meet
Kabungsuwan and interrupted his advance at Tinundan. After some
fighting they were evidently defeated and retreated up the river. The
people of Magindanao, under the leadership of the brothers Tabunaway
and Mam&#257;lu, came next, but their attitude was not hostile. For
some reason they secured an alliance or agreement with Kabungsuwan and
invited him to Magindanao. They submitted to a form of Mohammedan
baptism and to circumcision, and towed Kabungsuwan&rsquo;s boat from
that place up to Magindanao. Hence the meaning of the word
<i>tinundan</i>, the place of towing. The ceremony for circumcision
occurred at Katuri, the little settlement on the river just opposite
Cotabato; the baptism or washing occurred at Paygwan at the mouth of
the river. The word <i>katuri</i> means circumcision.</p>
<p>The <i>dumatus</i> urge that Tabunaway and Mam&#257;lu had been
Mohammedans previous to that incident and that they had some intimate
relation to Kabungsuwan. This is possible, but it is very difficult to
understand how such a submission could have been enforced or obtained
had Kabungsuwan been a mere relative and guest whom they had never seen
before. The people of Magindanao proper were, even in the best days of
the sultanate, far outnumbered by the people of Slangan. Yet, soon
after his arrival in Magindanao, Kabungsuwan went on conquering and
converting to Islam all the surrounding tribes and chiefs, and
succeeded. This seems impossible of achievement unless Kabungsuwan had
some force with him which commanded the fear and respect of the
natives, and which, with the aid of Magindanao, was able to carry his
arms to victory over all the neighboring native chiefs and tribes of
the land. This force was in all probability made up of the Samals who
accompanied him from Juh&#363;r and who remained in his service and in
the neighboring seas for a certain period of time. But having married
in Mindanao, the succession to Kabungsuwan&rsquo;s sultanate naturally
reverted to the native element, and the Samals were gradually alienated
and their sympathy with their master grew steadily weaker. Not being
agricultural in their habits and preferring the sea, they gradually
withdrew from Magindanao. The natives proved superior to the Samals
and, though converted to Islam, they preserved, to a great extent,
their own identity and their language. Knowing how insignificant the
former chiefs and their settlements had been, it is not difficult for
us to conceive how Kabungsuwan, with a small foreign force but with
superior talent and with superior arms, could so easily accomplish the
conquest of Magindanao. It is commonly believed that the natives who
fought Kabungsuwan had no swords and depended chiefly on their wooden
arrows as implements of war, and that the Mohammedans who attacked the
natives fought with swords and gained an easy victory. Possibly they
used gunpowder, too.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Slangan, Magindanao, Katitwan, and those of all
the other settlements of the valley were pagans and were very similar
to the present Tirurays in language and worship. Those who adopted the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>new religion remained in the rich lowlands of the
valley, but those who refused fled to the mountains and have stayed
away ever since. Those who wavered in accepting the new terms of
submission and who were later suffered to stay in the neighboring hills
were called Tiruray. Those who refused to submit, fled to more distant
places, and kept up their enmity and opposition were called Manobos.
The pagans who are thus spoken of as related to the Moros of Mindanao
in origin, besides the above, are the Bilans, the Tagabilis, and the
Subanos.</p>
<p>Every settlement of these former pagan tribes had its chief. The
chief was called <i>timway</i>. Tabunaway was the last <i>timway</i> of
Magindanao. Manumbali was the last <i>timway</i> of Slangan. The
Tirurays and the Manobos still call their chief <i>timway</i>. The
ruler of the Mohammedan dynasty assumed the title of datu. The noun
<i>datu</i> means king or ruler; the verb <i>datu</i> means to rule.
Kabungsuwan retained the title sharif. His son Maka-alang also is
always referred to as sharif. Later the term datu prevailed, and the
first datu who is mentioned in the <i>tarsila</i> as sultan was Sultan
Qudrat, whom Comb&eacute;s called Corralat.</p>
<p>Soon after Kabungsuwan had established his power in Magindanao he
received the submission of many chiefs, all of whom he converted to
Islam. Later he advanced up the valley to Bwayan and along the coast to
Malabang. Some believe that he went to the Ranao country, but it is
difficult to support all the statements made. His descendants and his
converts carried on the war and the conversion, so that before the
Spaniards reached their country their conquest and conversion had
reached the present limits.</p>
<p>The story of Putri Tun&#299;na and her marriage to Kabungsuwan is
universally known to the Moros of Mindanao. The custom of burying the
dead next to the house, as practiced by Tabunaway, is still common
everywhere, and trees are often planted around the tomb.</p>
<p>By Sarabanun, the sister of Tabunaway, Kabungsuwan begot no
children. By Putri Tun&#299;na he begot three daughters, one of whom,
Putri M&#257;m&#363;r, married the first Moslem datu of Bwayan,
M&#257;lang-sa-Ing&#365;d. At Malabang Kabungsuwan married
Angint&#257;bu, the daughter of the chief of that place, and begot
Sharif Maka-alang, who succeeded him.</p>
<p>The people of Magindanao who aided Kabungsuwan in his wars secured
from him certain privileges and favors over their neighbors. These
privileges are still claimed by the d&#363;m&#257;t&#363;s, the present
descendants of Tabunaway. They have not paid tribute to the datus and
have often intermarried with the datu class. It was different with the
people of Slangan. The descendants of Manumbali and his subjects all
became subjects and servants to the datus. Their descendants are,
however, still known and live in Lugaylugay, about 1 mile below
Cotabato, and on the same side of the Pulangi. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>Little is known about Sharif Maka-alang. He in all probability ruled
in Magindanao, not in Malabang. His wife was a Bilan woman related to
Par&#257;sab, a Bilan chief.</p>
<p>Bangk&#257;ya succeeded Maka-alang and married three wives,
daughters of the principal chiefs of Slangan, Magindanao, and Matampay,
by each one of whom he begot a son. His sons were Dimasangkay,
G&#363;gu Sarik&#363;la, and Kapitan L&#257;wut Bw&#299;san, all of
whom become datus and succeeded to the rule of Magindanao in order.
Sarik&#363;la married a Sulu princess called Raja Putri, who was
supposed to be the noblest lady of her day in Magindanao and who
probably was the daughter of the sultan of Sulu. The word <i>Putri</i>
is equivalent to &ldquo;princess,&rdquo; and <i>Raja Putri</i> means
&ldquo;royal princess.&rdquo; <i>Kapitan</i> means &ldquo;holder&rdquo;
or &ldquo;leader.&rdquo; <i>L&#257;wut</i> is a Malay word meaning
&ldquo;sea.&rdquo; <i>Bw&#299;s</i> means &ldquo;tax.&rdquo; Kapitan
L&#257;wut Bw&#299;san distinguished himself more than his predecessors
and was the most powerful enemy Spain encountered in the south in her
first effort to reduce the Moro land. In 1597, in company with
Sil&#363;ngan, the raja of Bwayan, he checked the invasion of Marquis
Rodriguez and defeated him at Tampakan.</p>
<p>Bw&#299;san was succeeded by his son, Sultan Dipatw&#257;n Qudrat,
the Corralat of Comb&eacute;s. The word <i>Dipatw&#257;n</i> is Malay
in origin and means &ldquo;master&rdquo; or &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; The word
<i>qudrat</i> is Arabic and means &ldquo;power.&rdquo; The letters
<i>d</i> and <i>r</i> and <i>r</i> and <i>l</i> are interchangeable in
Moro, and the word <i>qudrat</i> is commonly pronounced <i>kudlat</i>
or <i>kurlat</i>; hence the corrupted form &ldquo;Corralat.&rdquo;
Sultan Qudrat overshadowed his father, Bw&#299;san, and ruled with a
strong hand. He was probably the strongest and greatest Mindanao sultan
that ever lived. He fought the Spaniards bitterly and held their
sovereignty in check for many years. His pirates terrorized Luzon and
the Visayas and controlled the southern seas for a long time.</p>
<p>In 1636 General Corcuera led an expedition against him and after
considerable difficulty reduced his fort and defeated his forces.
Qudrat appears to have had a large number of firearms, and his fort was
very strongly fortified. The Spaniards captured 8 bronze cannons, 27
<i>lantaka</i> or culverins, and 100 muskets.</p>
<p>In 1645 his relations with Spain had undergone a distinct change. He
had become more powerful, but he was desirous of peace and made a
treaty with the Spanish Government. This treaty was in the nature of an
alliance for mutual aid and protection. It secured better commercial
facilities and gave the Jesuits the privilege of building a church in
the sultan&rsquo;s capital. Thirteen years later hostilities were
renewed and another campaign was directed against Simway. This time
Qudrat succeeded in blocking the river at different places and
successfully checked the invasion.</p>
<p>Qudrat was followed by his son, Dundang Tidulay, of whom very little
is known. Sultan Dundang Tidulay begot Sultan Mohammed
sa-Baraham&#257;n and Sultan Mohammed Kah&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n Kuda.
Baraham&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>ruled peacefully and begot several children, two
of whom, J&#257;par S&#257;dik Man&#257;mir and Dipatw&#257;n
Anw&#257;r, became sultans.</p>
<p>After the death of Sultan Baraham&#257;n his son Man&#257;mir was
declared sultan. As Man&#257;mir was very young, his succession was
considered illegal and an act of enmity directed against his uncle,
Kuda. Kuda therefore &ldquo;usurped the government and went to Simway,
carrying with him the effects of the deceased sultan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Civil war ensued and the peace of the state was greatly disturbed.
This war must have lasted more than thirty years, and its story is
variously related by the Moros. The <i>tarsila</i> do not mention it at
all. The best description was given by Captain Forest, who learned its
details from the mouth of Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na, the chief person who
conducted the campaign and terminated the struggle.</p>
<p>Kuda invited a party of Sulus living in Magindanao to Simway to
support him against his nephew. The Sulus came, but finding him with
only a small force, they treacherously murdered him and plundered his
camp and possessed themselves of many pieces of heavy cannon, which
Kuda had transported from Magindanao to Simway. &ldquo;The Sulus
returned home with their booty, and Man&#257;mir&rsquo;s party got the
ascendency.&rdquo; But the Sulus, conscious of their iniquity and
fearful of resentment when peace should be restored, fomented trouble
between Man&#257;mir and his brother Anw&#257;r, and supported the
latter. The state was again divided against itself, and the second
struggle proved worse than the first. Skirmishes were kept up and
nightly attacks and assassinations were continued until both sides were
very much weakened. Their enmity grew bitter and Mal&#299;nug, the son
of Anw&#257;r, killed his uncle Man&#257;mir. Man&#257;mir was the
rightful sultan, and on account of his assassination he has ever since
been called Sah&#299;d Mup&#257;t, which means &ldquo;died a
martyr.&rdquo; Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na and Pak&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n, the
sons of Sah&#299;d Mup&#257;t, were obliged to leave Magindanao, and
retired to Tamontaka. &ldquo;The country then suffered much. The great
palace at the town was first plundered and then burned. In the
conflagration many of the houses of Magindanao were destroyed, as was
also a great part of the town of Slangan. The groves of cocoanut trees
were also mostly destroyed, as being convenient and at hand to make
palisades for temporary forts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Sultan Anw&#257;r died at Batwa and has ever since
been referred to as Mup&#257;t Batwa, which means &ldquo;died in
Batwa.&rdquo; Mal&#299;nug assumed the sultanate after his
father&rsquo;s death and kept up the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a tedious, desultory war, Mal&#299;nug fled up the
Pulangi to Bwayan. Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na then got possession of all
the lands about Magindanao, and peace was made soon after. Mal&#299;nug
died a natural death, and some time later his two sons visited
Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pak&#299;r Mawl&#257;na was a man of low stature, smiling
countenance, and communicative disposition. He acquired a great
reputation for wisdom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span>and bravery during the civil war, which he
brought to a happy conclusion. He spoke Malay and wrote the best
<i>tarsila</i> of Magindanao. Magindanao flourished in his day and
regained its former glory and prosperity. His pirates invaded the
Celebes and had several encounters with Dutch and English vessels,
often with success. His relations with Spain were friendly, but Spain
had very little influence outside of the Zamboanga colony.</p>
<p>The greater part of Magindanao was in his days built on the point
and the adjacent narrow strip of land which lies at the junction of the
Matampay and the Pulangi and between them. A longitudinal raised street
began at the point and extended for half a mile to a canal which was
cut from river to river. More than 150 houses were situated on both
sides of this street. The other part of the town of Magindanao did not
exceed 20 houses. The town of Slangan was really continuous with
Magindanao and extended for about half a mile down the river, forming
one continuous street. Slangan was the larger town and had over 200
houses. Both towns had large numbers of mechanics, vessel builders, and
merchants. Many Chinese carpenters, arrack distillers, and millers
lived in both towns, but chiefly in Slangan. Gardens and rice fields
surrounded the town. The chief datus at that time had forts and kept
small bodies of troops as bodyguards and artillery corps to take care
of the muskets and guns. Kib&#257;d Sahriy&#257;l, son of the sultan,
had the best and strongest fort at that time. This fort was called
<i>Kuta Intang</i> (diamond fort) and was located at the extreme point
of the land and commanded the river and the town. The fort had five
pieces of cannon, 6 and 9 pounders, and a large number of swivels and
<i>lantaka</i>. The Magindanao warriors of those days wore armor coats
and helmets and carried krises, spears, and shields. The natives made
gunpowder and secured their saltpeter from a cave near Taviran. They
built vessels of all dimensions and cruised as far as Java and the
Celebes. Their vessels were always long for the breadth and very broad
for their draft of water.</p>
<p>In 1774 Mawl&#257;na retired from office in favor of his brother,
Pak&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n. Pak&#257;r was a weaker man than his brother
and practically had very little control over affairs, and always acted
in important state questions with the advice and consent of Kib&#257;d,
his nephew. During his time the English tried to get Bongo Island and
to establish a footing near the mouth of the Pulangi.</p>
<p>Sultan Pak&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n was succeeded by Kib&#257;d
Sahriy&#257;l, who possessed many of the good qualities of his father
and ruled with firmness and success. In the meantime the power of Spain
in Mindanao had revived and her forces became active again. Kib&#257;d
maintained friendly <span class="corr" id="xd21e2779" title=
"Source: relaitons">relations</span> with Spain and signed a treaty
with her in 1794, in which he promised not to enter into any treaty or
agreement with another power. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like his father he had many wives and concubines and begot many
children, chief among whom are Sultan Kaw&#257;sa and Alamansa
Sul-Karnayn.</p>
<p>Kaw&#257;sa succeeded his father and maintained the dignity of his
office and the prosperity of his sultanate. He is often called
Anw&#257;ru-d-D&#299;n (lights of religion) and Am&#299;ru-l-Umara (the
prince of the princes). He had many children, chief of whom was
Intir&#299;nu or Am&#299;rul.</p>
<p>Alamansa died at Dansalan. He had many children, two of whom were
Raja Tw&#257;, and Datu Dak&#363;la, the prince of Sibugay. Raja
Tw&#257; begot Untung and Perti. The nation looked to Raja Tw&#257; to
succeed Sultan Kaw&#257;sa, but he died before his uncle, and the
sultanate fell to his young son, Untung. Intir&#299;nu was rejected for
family reasons and Datu Dak&#363;la was set aside to give
representation to the favorite house of Tw&#257;.</p>
<p>Untung was known as Sultan Sakandar Qudratu-l-L&#257;h (Alexander,
the power of God). He was also surnamed Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam
(A&rsquo;zham), which means &ldquo;greatest beauty.&rdquo; Qudrat the
Second was the last sultan who observed all the customs and rites of
the sultanate. He was young when he assumed power, and his reign marked
the beginning of the downfall of the sultanate and the actual
occupation by Spain of the Rio Grande Valley. In the treaty of 1837 he
submitted to the sovereignty of Spain and accepted the subordinate
title of Feudatory King of Tamontaka. Spain appointed his successor and
prohibited his people from invading any territory west of Point
Flechas. She regulated the licensing of boats sailing beyond Zamboanga
and erected a trading house at Paygwan, at the mouth of the Rio
Grande.</p>
<p>In 1843 Datu Dak&#363;la ceded to Spain the west coast of the
Zamboanga peninsula, promised to aid in suppressing slavery, and
acknowledged Spanish protection.</p>
<p>In 1845 Sultan Qudrat confirmed the treaty of 1837, with a more
definite submission, and allowed the establishment of a Spanish trading
house at Cotabato.</p>
<p>This aggression on the part of Spain was prompted by her increased
strength and an additional naval revival. Steamboats and improved
firearms ended Moro aggression and solved the Moro question. In 1851
Polloc was occupied and was made a naval station. In 1857 Spanish boats
advanced as far up as Tambao and drew up a treaty with the sultan of
Talak&#363;k&#363; in which he acknowledged his surrender and his
submission to the authority of Spain. In 1861 camps were established at
Cotabato, Libungan, Tambao, Taviran, and Tamontaka.</p>
<p>Sultan Qudrat begot Mamak&#363;, Ambuludtu, Mast&#363;ra, Raja
Putri, and others. Mamak&#363; is the present Raja Muda of Magindanao
and lives at Cran, Sarangani. Ambuludtu and Mast&#363;ra are living at
N&#363;ling, about 1 mile above Cotabato. Raja Putri, generally known
as the Princesa, was Datu &#362;t&#363;&rsquo;s wife. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sultan Mohammed Makakwa, the son of Intir&#299;nu, succeeded Qudrat.
He was the last sultan of Magindanao who lived in Cotabato. The
Spaniards paid him a monthly salary of 70 pesos, but kept him under
complete control. In his days modern Cotabato was built, and in 1871 it
was made the capital of Mindanao. An earthquake destroyed the town that
year, and in 1872 it was abandoned as capital in favor of
Zamboanga.</p>
<p>Makakwa died about 1883, and his son, Pablu, became sultan.
Pablu&rsquo;s full title was Sultan Mohammed Jal&#257;lu-d-D&#299;n
Pablu. He lived at Ban&#363;bu, opposite Cotabato, and was the last
sultan who received a salary from the Spanish Government.</p>
<p>In 1884 the Spanish engaged the forces of Idr&#299;s, the sultan of
Talak&#363;k&#363;, on the banks of the river at Tambao and completely
defeated him. Idr&#299;s then signed a treaty acknowledging
unconditional surrender and submission.</p>
<p>During Pablu&rsquo;s life General Terrero conducted the campaign of
1886&ndash;87 against Datu &#362;t&#363; of Bwayan, and the Spanish
gunboats destroyed every fort on the river.</p>
<p>Datu &#362;t&#363; resisted the Spanish invasion vigorously and
repeatedly, but he was repeatedly defeated, and the Moros of the Rio
Grande felt convinced that the arms of Spain were much superior to
their own, and have submitted peacefully ever since. Pablu&rsquo;s
sultanate was nominal and powerless. In 1888 Pablu died, and the seat
of the sultanate remained vacant until about 1896. Pablu died without a
male heir. Mamak&#363;, the Raja Muda of Magindanao, did not meet the
requirements of the sultanate, so the sultanate passed over to the
house of Datu Dak&#363;la the First. The prince of Sibugay had three
sons, Pagat, Puy&#363; or Jam&#257;lu-l-Kir&#257;m, and Datu
Dak&#363;la the Second. Pugat, the eldest, begot Mamuppun, the last
prince of Sibugay, and Mangig&#299;n. Datu Dak&#363;la the Second begot
Datu Dak&#363;la the Third, who lives at Kumaladan, at the head of
Damanquilas Bay. Mamuppun was passed over by the council of the datus
in favor of Mangig&#299;n, the present sultan.</p>
<p>Mangig&#299;n is a weak man. After his succession he went to
Libungan and lived there during Spanish rule. After the Spanish
evacuation and after the attack on Cotabato by Datus Ali, Jimbangan,
and Piang, which occurred in 1899, he became fearful of the Saraya
datus and returned to peaceful Sibugay, his birthplace and the land of
his father.</p>
<p>In her conquest of Mindanao Spain directed her forces against the
district of Sibugay first, and then against Mindanao. The district of
Sibugay was in a state of complete submission before the Rio Grande
Moros were controlled. The subjection of Sibugay advanced to such an
extent that in 1896 the region was divided into three districts, to
each one of which a datu was assigned by Spanish authority. The datus
received orders and directions from the governor of Zamboanga direct,
and an annual tax of one <i>real</i> was imposed upon every Subano and
Moro male above the age of 18 years. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mohammedan conquerors of Mindanao and Sulu
established a new form of government planned on lines similar to those
of the Arabian caliphate, and adopted written codes of law for guidance
in the administration of the state. In all probability the art of
writing was not known in Mindanao and Sulu prior to the Mohammedan
invasion. The author has no knowledge of the existence of any written
law among the pagan tribes of Mindanao, nor of any written material
that antedates Islam in Mindanao or Sulu. The Moros are not savage,
though they seem so at first sight. As early as the end of the
fifteenth century they could read and write. Mohammedanism encouraged
education and invited learning. The Arabic alphabet was applied to the
Mindanao tongue, and old Arabic and Malay books on religion and law
were translated into the native Magindanao and Ranao dialects. The
Moros of Magindanao have translations of the Quran, Hadeeth, some books
on law, some commentaries on the Quran, some magic, and other varied
literature. Their original writings in the Magindanao tongue consist of
many genealogies and stories.</p>
<p>The Sulu Moros have done the same. They acted independently, but on
the same general lines.</p>
<p>The languages of Mindanao and Sulu are members of the general
Malayan family of languages, but they differ so much as to render
intercourse impracticable without an interpreter. The Moros are several
tribes, and each tribe differs as much from the others as the Visayan
and the Ilocano and the Igorot tribes differ one from another.</p>
<p>The laws of these tribes are different. They came from similar
sources, but they were worked out and compiled separately and
independently. The present chapter includes the best official codes of
Magindanao and Sulu. The manuscripts themselves are undoubtedly
authentic and complete. Every care has been taken to render the
translations as accurate and complete and useful as possible.

<h3 class="main">The Luwaran; or, The Laws of Magindanao</h3>
<div class="div3 subsection" id="ch2.2.1">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Introduction</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The term <i>Luwaran</i>, which the Mindanao Moros
apply to their code of law, means &ldquo;selection&rdquo; or
&ldquo;selected.&rdquo; The laws that are embodied in the
<i>Luwaran</i> are selections from old Arabic law and were translated
and compiled for the guidance and information of the Mindanao datus,
judges, and <i>pandita</i> who do not understand Arabic. The Mindanao
copies of the <i>Luwaran</i> give no dates at all, and nobody seems to
know when this code was made. They say it was prepared by the Mindanao
judges some time ago, but none of those judges is known by name. Datu
Mastura&rsquo;s copy of this code was written about 1886, and it is
undoubtedly copied from some older manuscript. The original
manuscript<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2863src" href="#xd21e2863" name=
"xd21e2863src">1</a> accompanying this code is older still, but it
bears no date at all.</p>
<p>The Arabic books quoted in the <i>Luwaran</i> are
<i>Minh&#257;ju-l-&#256;rifeen</i>, <i>Taqreebu-l-Intif&#257;</i>,
<i>Fathu-l-Qareeb</i>, and <i>Mir&#257;tu-t-Tull&#257;b</i>. The first
of these, generally known as the <i>Minh&#257;j</i>, is the chief
authority quoted. Datu &#362;t&#363; had an old copy of the
<i>Minh&#257;j</i> that looked more than two hundred years old. The
author of the <i>Minh&#257;j</i> must have lived in the ninth or tenth
century. The compilation of the <i>Luwaran</i> must have been made
before the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Each Mindanao datu is assisted in the administration of justice by a
judge and a vizier. The judge is called Datu <i>Kali</i>. The word
<i>kali</i> is derived from the Arabic word meaning
&ldquo;judge.&rdquo; The Datu Kali is the chief <i>pandita</i> of the
district and is supposed to be the best-informed man of the community.
The <i>pandita</i> is the scholar who can read and write and perform
the functions of a priest. The vizier is called
&ldquo;<i>wazir</i>;&rdquo; he is a <i>pandita</i>, too, and acts in a
semijudicial and clerical capacity. Mohammedan law being based on the
teachings of the Quran, the chief <i>pandita</i> of the district is
naturally regarded as the most competent expounder of the law and the
best-fitted person in the community to act as a judge. As the
<i>wazir</i> is a <i>pandita</i>, he should be a well-informed and wise
man. Some datus are <i>pandita</i> themselves, and some take all
matters into their own hands and delegate none of their offices or
duties to a judge or a vizier; but this is the exception, not the
rule.</p>
<p>In making the <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e2932" title=
"Source: Lawaran">Luwaran</span></i> the Mindanao judges selected such
laws as in their judgment suited the conditions and the requirements of
order in Mindanao. They used the Arabic text as a basis, but
constructed their articles in a concrete form, embodying genuine
examples and incidents of common occurrence in Mindanao. In some places
they modified the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>sense of the Arabic so much as to make it
agree with the prevailing customs of their country. In a few instances
they made new articles which do not exist in Arabic but which conform
to the national customs and common practices. The authority of the
<i>Luwaran</i> is universally accepted in Mindanao and is held sacred
next to that of the Quran. The Mindanao judge is at liberty to use
either of them as his authority for the sentence to be rendered, but as
a rule a quotation from the Quran bearing on the subject is
desirable.</p>
<p>All datus and viziers and all persons acting in the capacity of a
chief or a vizier find the <i>Luwaran</i> very convenient and helpful.
Very few people can become <i>kali</i>, but all who are able to read
can study and use the <i>Luwaran</i>. Consequently the <i>Luwaran</i>
has had general use, and copies of it are seen in all the districts
that speak the Magindanao dialect. To establish this fact copies of it
were secured from the ruling datus of Bagumbayan and of Saraya or the
upper valley.</p>
<p>The copy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2956src" href="#xd21e2956" name=
"xd21e2956src">2</a> secured from Datu Mastura is by far the most
complete of all. The text is well written, neat, and distinct. The
original Arabic articles are written separately on the margin of the
book and opposite the Magindanao articles with which they were supposed
to correspond. Datu Mastura is the best living descendant and
representative of the house of Mindanao, and he probably owns the most
reliable books and documents that have been transmitted from the
previous generations.</p>
<p>This book is certainly the best specimen of Magindanao literature;
it is genuine, correct, and well written. On account of inability to
secure the book itself, an accurate and exact copy of the same was
taken. The Magindanao articles are written separately and are numbered
for convenience in reference. The translation is not exactly literal,
but nearly so.</p>
<p>The Arabic marginal quotations are copied separately and are
numbered in the order in which they appeared in the original copy. They
are also translated, and a table indicating the Arabic quotation which
corresponds to each article of the <i>Luwaran</i> is attached to the
introduction to the translation.</p>
<p>In actual practice the Moros do not distinguish between custom and
law. Many of their customs are given the force of law, and many laws
are set aside on account of contradiction to the prevailing customs of
the day.</p>
<p>Slavery is such an established custom and institution of the land
that it is generally sanctioned and supported in the
<i>Luwaran</i>.</p>
<p>An oath on the Quran is so firmly binding and the fear of perjury is
so strong in the mind of the Moro that oaths are generally taken and
are always regarded as sufficient confirmation even in the absence of
evidence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Moros are not strict nor just in the execution of the law. The
laws relating to murder, adultery, and inheritance are seldom strictly
complied with. Indeed, the laws of inheritance as given in the
<i>Luwaran</i> are generally disregarded and are seldom considered at
all. Mohammedan law does not recognize classes, except the slave class.
But Moro law is not applied equally to all classes. Great preference is
shown the datu class, and little consideration is given to the children
of concubines.</p>
<p>The <i>Luwaran</i>, nevertheless, is the recognized law of the land
and compliance with it is a virtue.</p>

<p class="first">These quotations are given here in the same order in
which they appear on the margin of the original copy of the
<i>Luwaran</i>, with only a few clerical corrections. They are
selections from Arabic books on law and religion, and form the basis of
the Magindanao law as given in the <i>Luwaran</i>. The order they come
in does not always conform to the order of the corresponding articles
of the <i>Luwaran</i> to which they are appended. The Magindanao judges
who prepared the <i>Luwaran</i> used these texts or quotations as
authority for the corresponding Magindanao articles they made. But
subsequent scribes must have changed the order of these texts on
account of their ignorance of the meaning of the Arabic text and the
places where they should be applied.</p>

<h4 class="main">Translation of the Arabic Marginal Quotations of the
Luwaran</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. The person in charge of a property the subject of a
suit has the first right to that property; his right must, however, be
confirmed by oath. If both parties have charge of the property, their
rights shall be regarded equal, and both parties shall take oath.</p>
<p>2. The compensation for a slave shall be equal to his value. The
loss of a limb shall be compensated for by the amount by which that
loss reduces the value of the slave.</p>
<p>3. No indemnity shall attach to the loss or damage of an article
borrowed if such loss or damage be incurred in the proper use of such
article.</p>
<p>4. The plea of the defendant in reference to the loss of a borrowed
article shall be confirmed by oath. In cases of doubt the loss shall be
established first by evidence, and the plea of the defendant shall then
be confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>5. If the borrowed article or property is subjected to insecurity or
danger, responsibility shall attach to such an action.</p>
<p>6. No suit shall be triable after the lapse of fifteen years from
the date of the act giving rise to the suit. Imam Shafii restricted the
application of this law to cases where the plaintiff and the defendant
live in one town, and where the delay was avoidable.</p>
<p>7. Lost or damaged finds shall be compensated for in kind or in
value.</p>
<p>8. A find shall be the property of the finder irrespective of his
religion or character.</p>
<p>9. The find shall be delivered to its owner, if the owner is known.
The finder shall be held responsible for loss of the find or damage to
it as long as the find is in his charge.</p>
<p>10. Property seized by force shall be returned to its owner with
compensation for any loss that may have been incurred by the seizure.
If the seized property be lost, the seizer shall compensate for the
loss in kind or in value.</p>
<p>11. If the seizer and the owner differ concerning a defect in the
property, the owner&rsquo;s statement shall be valid if confirmed by
oath.</p>
<p>12. God said, &ldquo;To you believers I say, you shall not enter the
houses of others without their permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13. Mohammed said, &ldquo;Whoever enters the house of another shall
be responsible for the loss that may occur therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>14. If a divorce occurs after marriage but prior to sexual
intercourse, half the dower shall be paid. If the divorce occurs after
sexual intercourse, all the dower shall be paid.</p>
<p>15. No dower shall be paid if the marriage contract is broken prior
to sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>16. The expenses of the marriage feast shall not be recovered.</p>
<p>17. A gift conditioned on compensation may be recovered in kind or
value. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>18. The will of the giver and the acceptance of the receiver shall
determine the gift.</p>
<p>19. A gift not conditioned on compensation shall not be
recoverable.</p>
<p>20. A thief shall have his hands cut off.</p>
<p>21. The thief shall return the stolen property or compensate for its
loss.</p>
<p>22. The confession of the thief and the oath of the plaintiff shall
confirm the theft.</p>
<p>23. The plaintiff&rsquo;s oath if corroborated by evidence shall
confirm the theft.</p>
<p>24. If the statement of the defendant begins with confession and
ends with denial, the confession shall be regarded valid.</p>
<p>25. The testimony of a minor or insane person is null.</p>
<p>26. The testimony of a slave shall be valid when it bears a
disadvantage or punishment to himself.</p>
<p>27. A slave shall not be contracted with or loaned without the
permission of his master.</p>
<p>28. A slave shall be liable for the payment of a debt contracted
prior to liberation.</p>
<p>29. If the vender and the vendee differ as to the time a certain
defect developed in the property sold, the vender&rsquo;s claim shall
be sustained if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>30. Differences between the vender and the vendee as to the amount
or price of the property sold or date of the purchase shall be subject
to oaths by both parties.</p>
<p>31. If a defect in the purchased property is recognized after the
conclusion of the sale, the property may be returned to the vender, who
shall retain of its price an amount equal to the reduction in the value
of the property occasioned by the discovery of the defect.</p>
<p>32. The occurrence of a defect in a slave after the conclusion of
the contract does not constitute a right by which the vendee can revoke
the sale contract.</p>
<p>33. If a person purchases a slave and later presents a defective
slave and requests the revocation of the purchase contract, and the
vender denies the identity of the slave, the vender&rsquo;s statement
or plea shall be sustained if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>34. If a defect is observed during prayer or meals or at night,
notice thereof may be delayed for the time necessary to finish the
prayer or meal, or overnight.</p>
<p>35. Other nonpermissible delays annul the right to revoke a sale
contract.</p>
<p>36. If a debtor is sued by the legatee of the creditor and makes the
plea that the debt was canceled, the legatee shall take oath to the
effect that he has no knowledge of the cancellation of the debt.</p>
<p>37. A sale contract may be revoked if it does not define the price
of the property sold. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84"
name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>38. The right to property justifies breaking a door or breaking
through walls for the purpose of securing it, or its equivalent in
kind.</p>
<p>39. If a person spies on the wife of another person through cracks
or holes in her house and an occupant throws a stone at him which hurts
or kills him, no fault shall attach to such action.</p>
<p>40. If the owner of a cat is warned of the fact that his cat eats
fowls or provisions of others and the cat repeats such an act, the
owner of the cat shall be held responsible for its action.</p>
<p>41. If a woman is held as security for debt, and her trustee
cohabits with her, without the knowledge and consent of the debtor, his
action shall be regarded as adultery and he shall pay her dower. If
such cohabitation is with the consent of the debtor, no blame shall
attach to such action, but the creditor shall pay her dower. The child
born under such conditions shall be regarded as a free child, but his
value shall be paid to the debtor.</p>
<p>42. In cases of difference between the debtor and the creditor in
reference to the security and its value, the debtor&rsquo;s statement
shall be sustained if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>43. The creditor shall not be held responsible for the unavoidable
loss or destruction of the security.</p>
<p>44. In cases of difference between the principal and his agent in
reference to the compliance of the latter with the instructions of the
former, the statement of the principal shall be sustained if confirmed
by oath.</p>
<p>45. The penalty for adultery committed with a married woman shall be
eighty lashes.</p>
<p>46. If an agent is intrusted with the payment of a debt of his
principal and is sued by the creditor for his failure to pay the debt,
the statement of the creditor shall be valid if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>47. The penalty for adultery committed with an unmarried woman is,
according to the letter of the law, stoning to death of both
adulterers. This is generally reduced to 100 lashes for each
offender.</p>
<p>48. The judge shall first hear the evidence of the plaintiff if he
has any, and render judgment accordingly. If no evidence is produced,
the statement of the defendant shall be valid if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>49. The punishment for adultery committed by slaves is fifty
lashes.</p>
<p>50. In stoning adulterers both men and women shall be buried to the
level of the chest and the stones shall be of medium size.</p>
<p>51. If a man has sexual intercourse with the slave of another man
and she dies during childbirth, he shall pay a fine equal to her
value.</p>
<p>52. If a married Mohammedan is killed by a Christian on account of
adultery, the Christian shall be put to death; but if he is killed by
another Mohammedan, the latter Mohammedan shall not be put to
death.</p>
<p>53. If a plaintiff proves by evidence his ownership to a certain
animal or tree, he shall be entitled to the future produce of that
animal or tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>54. If a person secures a lease on a certain piece of land for the
purpose of cultivating it, he shall be bound by the terms of the lease
whether he cultivates the land or not. The payment is generally made at
harvest time.</p>
<p>55. If a slave runs away from his master and seeks refuge in the
house of another person who knows the master of the slave and such
person does not inform the master of the slave of the fact, such person
shall be held responsible for the slave whether the slave stays with
him or runs away again.</p>
<p>56. If a husband&rsquo;s absence is unusually long and no
information can be obtained concerning him, his wife shall not marry
another person unless she knows surely that he is dead or that she is
divorced.</p>
<p>57. If a ship is in danger of foundering, the cargo should be cast
overboard for the purpose of saving the passengers; but if a person
cast overboard another person&rsquo;s property without order or
permission, he shall be held responsible for the loss.</p>
<p>58. If a person under conditions similar to the preceding case
orders another person to cast his property overboard and such other
person casts his property overboard, no responsibility shall be
attached to the order, unless express responsibility is stated in the
order.</p>
<p>59. The estate of a deceased person shall be held as security for
the payment of his debt, whether the debt be known to his heirs prior
to or after the division of the estate.</p>
<p>60. The heir has the right to take possession of the estate if he
pays the debt with his own money.</p>
<p>61. No punishment shall attach to accidental murder while hunting,
whether the shooting be voluntary or forced.</p>
<p>62. If in such a case a fine is imposed, it shall be equally divided
between the shooter and the person who ordered the shooting.</p>
<p>63. If a person shoots at a tree and kills a person, or shoots at a
person and kills another, such murder shall be regarded as accidental
murder.</p>
<p>64. If a person is ordered to climb a tree and he falls and dies, no
blood money shall be paid by the person who gave the order, for such
murder is not intentional.</p>
<p>65. If a person claims that a certain child was born of a female
slave who conceived the child while in his possession, and confirms his
claim by witness and by oath, his claim shall be valid and the child
shall be regarded as a free child.</p>
<p>66. If a person claims that a certain slave had been his and was
liberated, and his claim is confirmed by a witness and by oath, the
slave shall be liberated again.</p>
<p>67. If two parties differ as to whether a certain property belongs
to one of the parties or to both of them as partners, the statement of
the party in charge of the property shall be valid if confirmed by
oath. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>68. If a person claims that the partnership has been dissolved and
that a certain property has become his own, and his claim is contested
by another party to the partnership, the statement of the latter party
shall be valid if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>69. If a person who is a party to a partnership buys a certain
property and states that such property has been bought for the
partnership, and his statement is contested by another party to the
partnership, the statement of the purchasing party shall be valid if
confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>70. God said, &ldquo;The punishment for murder has been ordained for
you, a free person for a free person, a slave for a slave, and a woman
for a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>71. Such punishment shall not be executed without the authority of
the <i>Imam</i> (Caliph).</p>
<p>72. A free person shall not be put to death for killing a slave, but
all grades of slaves shall be subject to such punishment.</p>
<p>73. A free woman or a hermaphrodite shall be regarded as half a man
in all considerations referring to person or injury.</p>
<p>74. If a free man divorces his wife three times or a slave divorces
his wife twice, it shall not be lawful for either of them to marry the
same woman again before she has been married to another person.</p>
<p>75. A nonpregnant woman shall mourn for her husband four months and
ten days in full. A nonpregnant slave woman shall mourn for her husband

<p>78. If a person throws sweepings or melon rinds on the road, he
shall be responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>79. If a person helps a child or insane person to poisoned food, he
shall be punished.</p>
<p>80. Adults and sane persons shall be liable to punishment for
murder; an intoxicated man is also liable to punishment for the same
offense.</p>
<p>81. Intentional intoxication fixes the liability to punishment.</p>
<p>82. A defendant&rsquo;s plea on the ground that he was a child or
insane at the time the murder or crime was committed, if reasonable and
confirmed by oath, shall be valid.</p>
<p>A child is exempt from oath and from punishment.</p>
<p>83. If a person startles a minor standing near the edge of a roof
(flat roof) and the minor falls and dies on that account, he shall pay
a heavy fine.</p>
<p>84. If a minor is accidentally alarmed and falls from a roof and
dies, the fine shall be light. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87"
href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>85. Injuries done to a slave are compensated for by the amount of
the reduction affecting his value.</p>
<p>86. Similar to 85.</p>
<p>87. A slave is liable to fine for his crimes; his master shall
either pay his fine for him or sell him to pay the fine, if the price
exceeds the fine. If the fine exceeds the price, the slave shall be
held personally responsible.</p>
<p>88. In case the plaintiff can not produce evidence or witness, the
defendant shall take the oath. But if the defendant refuses to take
oath, the plaintiff shall take oath and confirm the charge.</p>
<p>89. If the plaintiff claims that a certain adult person is his
slave, and the defendant denies the charge, the defendant&rsquo;s
statement shall be valid if confirmed by oath.</p>
<p>90. What is borrowed shall be returned in kind.</p>
<p>91. The will of a free adult shall be legitimate whether he be an
immoral person or an infidel. The will of the insane, the intoxicated,
the child, and the slave shall not be legitimate.</p>
<p>92. A will is null if the legatee dies before the testator;
otherwise it is legitimate, and [the property] may be transmitted to
the heirs of the legatee.</p>
<p>93. A will can not exclude legitimate heirs in the interest of one
heir alone, except with the consent of the excluded heirs.</p>
<p>94. A person may recover his property directly if that can be done
peaceably; otherwise he shall submit the case to the judge.</p>
<p>95. To be legal and binding the instructions and the trust of a
principal must be authentic.</p>
<p>96. The agent must be capable of independent action and must be of
age and sane. The agent shall not be a minor or insane.</p>
<p>97. In case of involuntary collision attended with the death of both
parties, the respective heirs shall pay a light fine. (This is intended
to secure aid for funeral expenses.)</p>
<p>98. If the collision is intentional, the fine shall be heavy. If
only one party intended the collision, such party shall be punished on
the merits of the case.</p>
<p>99. Minors and insane persons shall be judged like sane adult
people. (This has reference to conditions similar to those of the two
preceding cases.)</p>
<p>100. Male children, whether single or multiple, shall inherit all

<h4 class="main">The Principal Sulu Code</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This code was prepared by Sultan
Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam and was used without any modification by
Sultan Har&#363;n. The present sultan&rsquo;s minister, Hajji B&#363;tu
Abdul-B&#257;qi, has made a new code which has just been proclaimed,
but which has not yet met with general approval.</p>
<p>This copy of the old Sulu Code is the original which was used by the
Sultan Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam himself, and also by Sultan
Har&#363;n. It was written by Asmawil, the chief clerk and minister of
Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam. The manuscript was secured from Sheikh
Mustafa, former minister to Sultan Har&#363;n.</p>
<p>This code differs considerably from the former one used by Sultan
Pulalun, the father of Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam, which was more in
conformity with the letter of the Quran, much more severe in its
sentences; hence the change was welcomed.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Article</span> I</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. Whoever shall abduct the child of
a free man, and be found out, shall be fined twenty rolls or pieces
(<i>gajahilaw</i>) of calico (<i>siddip</i>) or its value.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4716src" href="#xd21e4716" name="xd21e4716src">5</a>
The abductor shall return the child. A bail also is required which
shall be equal in character and value to the abducted child.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sec.</span> 2. If the abductor of a free person is
a slave, the master of the slave shall be examined to find out whether
or not the abduction was committed with his knowledge and consent. In
case he says that it was done without his knowledge and consent he must
be sworn on the Quran. But, though he swears to that effect, he shall
be held responsible for the return of the abducted person. Then if the
actual abductor or abductors do not return the person or persons
abducted, he or they shall be taken in payment thereof.</p>
<p>But if the master of the slave does not swear to that effect, he
shall be held responsible personally for the abduction, and the case
shall be treated as a case of abduction by a free man. The condition of
the slave, whether privileged to live independently or not, does not
affect this decision.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Article</span> II</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. (<i>a</i>) If property of any
kind of the sultan is stolen, the thief shall be fined fifty pieces
(<i>gajahilaw</i>) of calico.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) If property of datus with official titles or that of Twan
Sarip Usman is stolen, the thief shall be fined thirty-five pieces of
calico.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) If datus without official title or descendants of a Sarip
or of Panglima Adaq are robbed, the thief shall be fined thirty pieces
of calico.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) If ministers of state or Panglima Pihaq are robbed, the
thief shall be fined twenty-five pieces of calico.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) If subordinate officers below the
<i>panglima</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4767src" href="#xd21e4767"

agents of the sultan or <i>panglima</i> are robbed, the thief shall be
fined twenty pieces of calico.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) If children of subordinate rulers or chiefs are robbed,
the thief shall be fined ten pieces of calico.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sec.</span> 2. (<i>a</i>) Theft of small articles
(petit larceny) such as articles of diet, etc., of the value of one
piece or half of a <i>kusta</i> or sarong, shall not be punished by
fines, but the articles themselves shall be restored to the proper
owner or owners, twofold, and the thief shall suffer fifty lashes; if
the theft is repeated on two or three occasions, the offense shall then
be regarded as a case of great theft. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Theft of property of the value of one <i>kusta</i> and
over is great theft (grand larceny) and shall be punished by fine as
provided in section one: <i>Provided further</i>, That the articles of
property stolen shall be restored to the owner or owners thereof, and
the thief shall suffer one hundred lashes.</p>
<p>The fine shall be divided between the person robbed and the governor
(the chief usually acts as judge), in the following manner: When no
trial shall have been held, the robbed party shall receive seven parts
and the governor three parts; if a trial is held, the fine shall be
divided equally between the governor and the party robbed, whether he
be a person of rank or otherwise.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) If the thief is a great or noted person or a governor,
the fine shall be doubled.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The same penalty shall be applied to all persons
convicted of theft, whether male or female.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) In all cases of theft the stolen property shall be
restored to the owner or owners thereof.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) The buyer of stolen property shall be regarded as a thief
unless he proves the truth of the sale in the presence of the governor.
If he fails to have the seller examined and brought before the
governor, he shall be regarded as a partner in the theft.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Article</span> III</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. A false claim to property or debt
shall be regarded as theft and shall be adjudicated accordingly.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Article</span> IV</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. Whoever exacts a claim by force
without the permission or direction of the governor shall return
whatever he exacts and forfeit his claim; and in case the claim is not
substantiated he shall return the exacted object, and shall be fined
two pieces of calico, to be equally divided between the governor and
the person from whom he has exacted.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Article</span> V</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. Complainants who disagree upon
the authority before which they should appear shall come to a
<i>panglima</i>. In case they do not agree upon a <i>panglima</i> they
must come to the sultan. But in case they agree, it is preferable that
they should appear before the local governor or authority.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Article</span> VI</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. Whoever attempts to kill and
kills a freeman shall be fined fifty pieces of calico as blood money,
also twenty <i>gajahilaw</i> to be paid to the governor.</p>
<p>Whoever attempts to kill, but fails to kill, a freeman shall be
fined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>twenty-five pieces of calico, to be paid to the
attacked party, and ten <i>gajahilaw</i> to be paid to the
governor.</p>
<p>Cases of unintentional and accidental killing and cases where the
killing is done by an undetermined party shall be regarded alike. The
blood money in each case shall be thirty <i>gajahilaw</i>.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;In case a murder
occurs in a neighborhood or village, and the actual murderer is
unknown, the blood money is paid by the people of that neighborhood or
village. They pay the full amount of blood money in case they do not
swear to the effect that they did not commit the murder, but in case
they swear to that effect they pay only half the fine.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Article</span> VII</p>
<p><span class="sc">Section</span> 1. The fine for marriage by

dower is expressed in terms of slaves, the value of the slave shall be
considered equal to four pieces or <i>gajahilaw</i>. The price of the
bride, usually paid to the parents of the woman, in ounces of gold,
called in Sulu <i>basing</i>, will be paid at the rate of one
<i>gajahilaw</i> for a <i>basing</i>. The governor&rsquo;s share of the
fine shall be four <i>gajahilaw</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sec.</span> 2. The fine for elopement is four
<i>gajahilaw</i> and the dower shall not be doubled. The slave&rsquo;s
rate of exchange shall be four <i>gajahilaw</i> in case it is the
custom of her family to receive actual slaves as a dower. The
<i>basing&rsquo;s</i> rate of exchange is one <i>gajahilaw</i>.</p>
<p>In case the slave dower is nominal, the slave&rsquo;s rate of
exchange shall be three <i>gajahilaw</i> of calico, and the
<i>basing</i> one piece of <i>kusta</i>, of low grade.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sec.</span> 3. In case of seduction admitted or
disguised, marriage shall be concluded if the woman requests it. The
man shall be fined two <i>gajahilaw</i> and the woman shall be treated
as if she eloped. In cases of actual slave dowers, the slave&rsquo;s
rate shall be four <i>gajahilaw</i> and the <i>basing</i> one
<i>gajahilaw</i>. In cases of nominal slave dower, the slave&rsquo;s
rate shall be three <i>gajahilaw</i> and the <i>basing&rsquo;s</i> one
piece of <i>kusta</i> of the low grade.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sec.</span> 4. Compulsory marriage is treated as
marriage by abduction.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sec.</span> 5. (<i>a</i>) If adultery is committed
with a <i>panglima&rsquo;s</i> wife, the man shall be fined fifty
<i>gajahilaw</i>, which can not be exchanged with anything except gold,
silver, brass drums, or <i>lantaka</i>. If unable to pay, the man
himself shall become the property of the <i>panglima</i>.<a class=

href="#xd21e5011" name="xd21e5011src">10</a> the man shall be fined
forty <i>gajahilaw</i>; which can not be exchanged except as in the
previous case. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=

<p>(<i>c</i>) If adultery is committed with the wife of a subordinate
officer of state or a country <i>pandita</i>, or an agent of a
governor, the man shall pay a fine of thirty <i>gajahilaw</i>,
unexchangeable except as in section five (<i>a</i>).</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) If adultery is committed with the wife of a
<i>pandita</i> who is in the council or in the capital of the sultan,
the man shall pay forty <i>gajahilaw</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) If adultery is committed with any married woman, the man
shall pay a fine of twenty <i>gajahilaw</i>, unexchangeable except as
in section five (<i>a</i>).</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) If a married woman commits adultery with her own consent,
she becomes a slave to her husband; but if it is compulsory and without
her consent, she will not be subjected to slavery; it is her duty then
to tell her husband or his nearest relatives of the fact at the
earliest opportunity&mdash;the next morning in case it occurs at
night.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) If a male slave commits adultery with a free married
woman, the slave becomes the property of the husband of that woman.</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) If a free man commits adultery with a married female
slave, the decision will be the same as if the crime had been committed
with a free married woman.</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) If a male slave commits adultery with a married female
slave against her consent, the male slave becomes the property of the
master of the married female slave; but if the crime is committed with
her consent, she becomes the property of the master of her husband. Her
master pays the fine due the governor.</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) If a man commits adultery with the sister of his wife,
his wife not being divorced, he will be judged as if he had committed
adultery with the wife of another man.</p>
<p>All the subordinate officers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5091src"
href="#xd21e5091" name="xd21e5091src">11</a> of state are hereby
requested to exercise all care in administering justice to all who come
to them for judgment and decision. They should all adhere to the seven
articles of Mohammedan law and be deliberate in their just
application.</p>
<p>In case any complainant appeals to one of you from the decision of
another authority, do not accept the appellant&rsquo;s statement and
render your decision unless you inquire well about the case from the
previous authority who judged it. In case you find the decision of that
authority wrong do not be ready and quick to blame him and criticise
him, but try to act in conformity and union. In case you find his
decision right, notwithstanding the appellant&rsquo;s complaints, bring
both the appellant and the appellee to the <i>panglima</i>. If the
<i>panglima</i> can not render a solution, he should bring them to the
sultan, together with the authority from whose decision the appeal was
made and the authority to whom the appeal was made. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>If the governor or the authority to whom they appeal does not
investigate or inquire about the case from the governor from whom they
have appealed, his decision shall be null and void.</p>
<p>Any person who exercises the right to judge without authority from
the sultan shall be fined one male slave.</p>
<p>All governors and their subjects ought to abide by and aid in

<h4 class="main">The New Sulu Code</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The new code is a rearrangement of the old code with
some changes and modifications. Its author is Hajji B&#363;tu
Abdu-l-B&#257;qi, the present prime minister or adviser of the Sultan
Jam&#257;lu-l-Kir&#257;m the Second. It was issued in the latter part
of 1902, but there has been so much objection to it on the part of many
datus and chiefs that its general adoption seems impossible.</p>
<p>For a Sulu Hajji B&#363;tu is a man of talent and understanding. He
knows some Arabic and is probably the best Sulu scholar in the
Archipelago.</p>
<p>This code greatly increases the fines exacted from the people,
creates a treasury under the control of Hajji B&#363;tu, and entitles
the sultan to a share of the fines collected by the various datus and
chiefs. The chiefs and the people look upon it as another form of
unjust taxation. The opposition to its adoption is so strong and so
bitter that nothing except force of arms can enforce its use. This is
beyond the power of the present sultan.</p>

<p>PRAISE BE TO GOD. GLORY BE TO GOD. THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD. GOD IS
ALMIGHTY</p>
<p>This oration was finished at noon, Friday, the 29th of
Rabi-el-Akhir, in the year 1321 Hejira.</p>
<p>In the name of God the Compassionate and Merciful. God is greatest.
God is exalted. He is the Master of the World and the King of the
Universe who rules with conquering power. Invisible to the eye, He is
visible through His power and might. His is all the power and glory.
His is all kindness and glory. He is the Almighty and the Ruler of All.
He is everlasting and never dies. There is no God but He. Everything
vanishes but the face of God. He is our Governor, and to Him all shall
return. Before Him the learned men are humiliated; and the mighty
humble themselves in His presence. All the prophets have spoken of His
Lordship; and all the men of old have borne witness to His unity. All
the men of learning have spoken of His eternal being. The wise men are
unable to give an adequate description of His attributes. All that is
in the earth and the heavens acknowledge His worship, and praise Him
day and night without ceasing. God is greatest. He is the Lord of Lords
and the Liberator of the World. He inspired the Book and commands the
clouds. He overcomes all difficulties. He is the Cause of all Causes.
He opens all doors and answers all who call Him. The Lord has said,
&ldquo;Call Me, and I shall answer you. All who despise My worship
shall enter hell.&rdquo; God is almighty. All the heavens praise Him.
The sandy deserts, the shades and all darkness, on the right and on the
left, praise Him morning and night. There is nothing that does not sing
His praises; but you can not understand their praises. Oh, how kind and
forgiving He is! God is almighty. All the angels praise Him. The
heavens, the earth, the mountains and hills, and all the birds praise
Him. Praise and glory be to Thee, O Lord. Thou art the Lord of
Indescribable Might and Honor. Peace be to the missionaries, and praise
to God, the Lord of the Universe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"

<p class="first">Here the orator shall repeat, &ldquo;God is
almighty,&rdquo; seven times, then say the following:</p>
</div>
<p>God is Almighty. Praise be to God, the God of Kindness and of Grace,
who ordained that the faithful should observe the month of fasting and
gave them at the end thereof a feast, to all whether near or far, in
token of His hospitality and generosity. Let us praise him always. He
is righteous and all sacredness. The King of the Universe, land and
sea. He ordained for the Mohammedans the two feasts, Ramadan and that
of the Sacrifice. I bear witness that there is but one God, who is
alone without a partner. He made the two feasts for the observance of
all Mohammedans and the time of their celebration the greatest season
of the year. I testify that Mohammed is His servant and apostle. God
bless Mohammed at all times and through all ages. Oh, you people, fear
God. May God have mercy on you fellow-Mohammedans and brothers in the
faith. He has sent down to you this exalting and magnifying day as an
expression of his generosity and hospitality. On this day He permits
you to feast and forbids you to fast. Respectful observance of this day
is pleasing to God and he who so observes it shall be greatly blessed.
Charity on this day is highly acceptable. All you ask on this day shall
be given you. On this day every call is answered. The prophet, God
bless him, said, &ldquo;On this day give charity for everyone, male and
female, for every free man, for every slave, for the young, and for the
old give a measure of flour or a measure of dates, a measure of rice, a
measure of raisins, or a measure of barley, or whatever you eat on this
day give as charity for all the people who are of your religion, of
your nation and under your law. This will atone for your sins and all
your misdeeds during the days of fasting.&rdquo; The prophet, God bless
him, has said, &ldquo;He who fasts the month of Ramadan and withholds
his measure of charity on the feast day, his fasting shall not be
acceptable to God, and he shall not reach heaven, but shall be stopped
halfway between earth and heaven.&rdquo; The prophet said, &ldquo;He
who fasts the month of Ramadan and follows it with six days of
<i>Shawal</i> shall be regarded as if he had fasted forever.&rdquo; May
God make us successful and honest and enlist us in the ranks of His
faithful followers. The best of all speech is the word of God, the
All-knowing King, the Exalted and the Respected. God himself, whose
word is perfect truth, said, &ldquo;When the Quran is read, listen to
it with attention, that ye may obtain mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Quran is read, ask refuge in God from the accursed devil.
Jesus, the son of Mary, said, &ldquo;God our Lord, send us a table from
heaven that we may all, from the first to the last, feast
thereon.&rdquo; Be Thou generous to us for Thou art the best of all
givers. Exalted is God the true King. There is no God but God, the Lord
of the great throne. He who calls another god whose deity he can not
prove shall render <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span>account to the Lord his God. Infidels can
not succeed. Say my Lord, forgive me, and have mercy upon me. Thou art
most merciful.</p>

</div>
<p>God is Almighty. Praise be to God, whose praise is exalted and
glorious. I testify that there is no God but God, and that He is alone
and has no partner. I bear witness that Mohammed is his servant and
apostle, and the bright light of the world. May God bless Mohammed and
all his people and descendants. Oh, ye people, depart from evil and
draw near to good. Avoid excess and ye shall be happy. God and His
angels bless the prophet. Ye who have faith bless Him also. Ye servants
of God answer His call, and bless Him through whom God has directed
you. O God, bless Mohammed and his descendants, for he has directed us
to paradise and the roads that lead thereto. O God, bless Mohammed and
his descendants because he warned us of the fire and its evils. O God,
forgive his followers, and his caliphs Abu-Bakar, Omar, Othman, Ali,
Talhat, Zubayr, Abdu-r-Rahm&#257;n the son of Awf, Sa&rsquo;din Saidin,
and Abi Ubaydat, because they are the princes of the faithful and the
best of all people. O God, forgive all other followers and friends of
your prophet, and all who follow them. Be kind to them in the day of
judgment. Give them and us mercy, for Thou art most merciful. O God,
perpetuate the power and the victories and the conquests of him whom
Thou hast chosen for the administration and good management of temporal
affairs and religion; he who beseeches the intercession of the faithful
prophet, our master, the Sultan Mohammed Pudhalun, the son of the late
Sultan Mohammed Jam&#257;lu-l-Kir&#257;m, and the Sultan, the master,
and the noble whom Thou hast chosen, Sultan
Esh-Shar&#299;fu-l-H&#257;shim, the kindled light of God; and our

protect the kind and generous late Sultan Alawa-d-D&#299;n, whose
descendants became the kings of the Sulu country. Protect the champion
of the Mohammedan religion and faith, the late Sultan Am&#299;rul

<p>O God, support Islam and all Mohammedans. Fight against atheism and
heresy and evil, the enemies of religion. Aid the ever-victorious
Sultan Ali Sh&#257;h, the great and most superior sultan; sultan of the
land and sea; and his heir, the late Sultan Sh&#257;h

Mustafa, the best of all things. Defend the late sultan and wise
Governor Sh&#257;h Badaru-d-D&#299;n Mohammed, the victorious. May God
perpetuate on earth his power, and his kingdom, and his justice.</p>
<p>O God, support the late Sultan Nasaru-d-D&#299;n, the victorious,
the administrator, and the able supporter of our religion; the late
Sultan Al&#299;mu-d-D&#299;n the First, Mohammed, the prince of the

God alone prevented from making the pilgrimage to the House, and who
was patient, lenient, and good, who encouraged good deeds and forbade
evil, and who was good in his administration. May God perpetuate his
kingdom, his power, his justice, and his kindness. May God forgive him
and his forefathers and be good to all of them and give them a place in
paradise. O God, aid all who befriend him; be the enemy of all his
enemies; uphold all who uphold him; reject those who reject him; and
vanquish those who may vanquish him. Be Thou his help and aid, and use
him as a sword of vengeance against all offenders.</p>
<p>Thou art my God, the God of Truth and Lord of the Universe.</p>
<p>O God, set right our leaders and our nation, our judges, our rulers,
our learned men, our lawgivers, our wise men, and our old men. Aid them
in righteousness, and guide us. O God, destroy the enemies of our
religion and unite the hearts of the faithful. Free the captives and
pay the debts of the debtors. Relieve the distressed and forgive the
living and the dead. God grant peace and safety to us and to the
pilgrims and to the travelers on land and on sea who are of the people
of Mohammed, for Thou art the most powerful, the best Master and the
best Helper.</p>
<p>O God, drive away famine and distress, and disease, and iniquity,
and oppression, and all calamities, and all evils outward and secret
that may exist in our country especially and the countries of the
Mohammedans in general, for Thou hast power over everything. Our Lord,
forgive us and forgive our brothers who preceded us in the faith, and
cast away from our hearts all jealousies and ill feeling toward the
faithful. O <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=

generous and compassionate and able to forgive.</p>
<p>This was written by the poor and humble pilgrim Hajji
Abdu-l-B&#257;qi, who hopes for forgiveness from the forgiving Lord and
who was the son of Twan Hatib Jawari, a native of Sulug and follower of
Shafi&rsquo;i and Ash&rsquo;ari.</p>
<p>May God forgive them and all Mohammedans and all the faithful.
Amen.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Sulu Friday Oration</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">IN THE NAME OF GOD THE COMPASSIONATE AND MERCIFUL. TO
GOD BE ALL THE PRAISE AND GLORY. THERE IS NO OTHER GOD BUT GOD</p>
<p>This I repeat a thousand times more than others. God is greater, far
greater, than He is thought to be. I testify that there is no God but
God alone. God is one, and only one. He has no partner. God is the
owner of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein. God is
owner of all.</p>
<p>I testify that Mohammed is His servant and His apostle, sent by Him
to guide all people to the true religion, and that His religion may
thereby be exalted above all others, though the unfaithful and the
worshipers of many gods may reject it. We ask Thee, O God, to bless
Mohammed and all his descendants and bestow on them all the blessings
that can be named and all the blessings that can be forgotten. I advise
ye, O people, and myself, servants of God, with fear of God which is
the sign of faith and God&rsquo;s command to us all.
Fellow-Mohammedans, the mercy of God be upon you. Friday is the chief
of all days. The apostle of God said: &ldquo;The day Friday is the
chief of all days.&rdquo; It is greater than the day of Ramadan and the
day of el-Adha and the day of Ashura.</p>
<p>Charity on Friday is preferable to all charity. Good deeds done on
Friday are preferable to all good deeds, and evil done on Friday is the
greatest evil that can be done. The noblest and best men have testified
to its greatness over other days. It is the beauty of all days and
years. It is a pilgrimage that the poor can make once every seven days.
Its observance intercedes for the offender before the King of Unbounded
Knowledge.</p>
<p>It has been told of the chosen prophet that he said: &ldquo;God
registers the name of the person who leaves out three successive
Fridays, on a tablet on which he keeps the number of liars.&rdquo; The
prophet said that he who leaves out three successive Fridays shall have
written on his forehead when the day of judgment comes: &ldquo;He has
no hope of the mercy of God.&rdquo; May God bless us and give us all
peace.</p>
<p>May it be that God has declared us among the successful and the
faithful and enlisted us into the number of His good servants. The best
of all utterances and constitutions are in the word of God, King of
Unbounded Knowledge, possessor of glory and of all reverence. It is God
the Highest who speaks and who is the truest of all speakers.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Quran is read you should listen attentively so that you may
obtain mercy. He said, and His saying is most precious and full of
wisdom, &ldquo;When you read the Quran ask God&rsquo;s help against the
accursed Satan.&rdquo; I take refuge in God the All Hearing and All
Knowing from the accursed Satan. Oh, ye who have believed, when you
hear the call for prayers on Friday go ye to hear God&rsquo;s word.
Leave your business, for you have a greater good and benefit in this.
May God bless the great Quran for us, and may he benefit us through its
texts and the wise mention of His name. May He reward us all with mercy
from the painful punishment.</p>
<p>I command you, and myself, with what God demands for good obedience
so that you may obey Him. And I prohibit you from doing evil and from
disobedience as He prohibits you so that you may not disobey him. I
pray for the plentiful reward of God for you and for myself, so that
you may seek Him; and I ask the pardon and forgiveness of God for you
and for myself and for all the faithful Mohammedans for He is gracious
and forgiving.</p>
<p>Praise be to God. I praise and exalt God with all my strength and I
testify that, there is no God but God. God is one and only one. God has
no partner. He knows all and has good news for you all. I testify that
Mohammed is the servant of God and His apostle, and a shining light to
the world. We ask Thee, O God, to bless Mohammed and his people and
descendants because he is our preacher and warner. To ye, Oh, people, I
say, fear God, draw near to good, and depart from evil. God and all His
angels bless the prophet. All ye believers bless him, too. Ye servants
of God, obey the call of God, and bless him who directed you to God. We
ask Thee, O God, to bless Mohammed and the people of Mohammed, for he
directed us to paradise and to the roads that lead thereto. We ask
Thee, O God, to bless Mohammed and the descendants of Mohammed, because
he warned us of the fire and its destruction. We ask Thee, O God, to
bless Mohammed because he conquered the kings of the infidels and their
empires. We ask Thee, O God, to forgive his followers and his
successors, Abu Bakar, Omar, Othman, Ali, Abi Ubaydat, for they are the
princes of the faithful and the best of all people. We ask Thee, O God,
to forgive his two sons, Hasan and Husein, and his two noble uncles,
Hamzat and Abbas; and mayst Thou be kind to all the emigrants and all
the allies and followers till the judgment day, that we may share Thy
mercy with them and through them, for Thou art most merciful. We ask
Thee, O God, to perpetuate the power, the victory, and the valor of
those whom Thou hast chosen for the good administration and good
conduct of our religious and worldly affairs, chief among whom is he
who begs the intercession of the faithful prophet, our master, the
sultan and the pilgrim, Mohammed Jam&#257;lu-l-Kir&#257;m, the brother
of the late sultan, the pilgrim Mohammed Badaru-d-D&#299;n the Second,
both of whom made the pilgrimage to the house Al-Har&#257;am.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>May God give them a place with the faithful.
They are the children of the late Sultan Mohammed
Jam&#257;lu-l-A&rsquo;lam. May God perpetuate his kingdom and his
power, and his justice and kindness. And may God forgive his
predecessors and his grandfathers and be good to them and give them a
place in paradise. We ask Thee, O God, to be friendly with those who
are friendly with him, and to antagonize them who are against him; give
victory to those who aid him; reject those who reject him; vanquish
those who disobey him, and be his help and helper and make him Thy
sword of vengeance against the offender. O God, my God, Thou art Truth
and the Lord of the Universe. O God, set right our leaders and our
nation, our judges, our rulers, our learned men, our lawgivers, our
wise men, and our old men. Aid them in righteousness, and guide us. O
God, destroy the enemies of our religion and unite the hearts of the
faithful. Free the captives and pay the debts of the debtors. Relieve
the distressed and forgive the living and the dead. God grant peace and
safety to us and to the pilgrims and to the travelers on land and on
sea who are of the people of Mohammed, for Thou art the Most Powerful,
the best Master and the best Helper.</p>
<p>O God, drive away famine and distress, and disease and iniquity, and
oppression, and all calamities, and all evils outward and secret that
may exist in our country especially and in the countries of the
Mohammedans in general, for Thou hast power over everything. Our Lord,
forgive us and forgive our brothers who preceded us in the faith, and
cast away from our hearts all jealousies and ill feeling toward the
faithful. O God, our Lord, Thou art kind and gracious and generous and
compassionate and able to forgive.</p>

<p>Najeeb M. Saleeby&rsquo;s <i>Studies in Moro History, Law, and
Religion,</i> and <i>The History of Sulu,</i> often bound together in a
single volume, provide an interesting insight in the traditions and
history of the Southern-most Islands of the Philippines. Predominantly
Muslim, this area was only nominally Spanish throughout much of its
history, and its rulers where <i>de facto</i> independent until the
middle of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Part I of this work starts with translations of some fanciful
genealogies, which trace back the ancestry of the Sulu Sultans to Adam
and Eve, and of course include the prophet Muhammad. This is followed
by translations of laws, and a history of the islands in Part II. In a
series of appendixes the text of a number of significant treaties are
given, which, among others, show the historical roots of the Philippine
claims on Sabah.</p>
<p>The author, Dr. Najeeb Mitry Saleeby, was born in 1870 in Souk
al-Gharb, a town near Beirut, Lebanon. He studied at the American
University in Beirut, and then at the Bellevue Medical School in the
US. During the Spanish-American War, he served as a surgeon in the US
Army. He came to the Philippines on the USS <i>Thomas</i> in October
1900, and was sent to Mindanao because of his knowledge of Arabic.
Although himself a Christian Arab, he quickly befriended many Muslims,
and respected the Muslims, their religion and culture. He decided to
remain in the Philippines after his assignment. He died in Baguio on
December 18, 1935.</p>
<p>This work first appeared as volume 4 of the Ethnological Survey
publications, printed in Manila by the Bureau of Public Printing. Part
I, <i>Studies in Moro History, Law, and Religion,</i> appeared in 1905;
part II, <i>The History of Sulu</i>, followed in 1908.</p>
